# Contributing

Please share any general questions, feature requests, or product feedback in our
[Convex Discord Community](https://convex.dev/community). We're particularly
excited to see what you build on Convex!

Please ensure that rust code is formatted with
[cargo fmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) and markdown files are
formatted with [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

Convex is a fast moving project developed by a dedicated team. We're excited to
contribute to the community by releasing this code, but we want to manage
expectations as well.

- We value a cohesive developer experience for folks building applications
  across all of our languages and platforms.
- We value transparency in how we operate.

Smaller PRs that affect documentation, comments, or small bugfixes are easy to
review and integrate. For any larger or more fundamental changes, get in touch
with us on Discord before you put in too much work to see if it's consistent
with our product plans. We are generally unlikely to take large or fundamental
changes as community contributions. We think carefully about how our APIs
contribute to a cohesive product in line with our roadmap, so we cannot promise
that larger PRs will get the same level of attention.

Instructions for building and running Convex packages locally:

- [Building the backend and CLI from source](BUILD.md)
- [Running the dashboard](npm-packages/dashboard-self-hosted/README.md)

Note: If you just want to self-host Convex and not modify the codebase, we
recommend using the pre-built Docker image or binary. See the
[self-hosted README](self-hosted/README.md) for more information.

By submitting pull requests, you confirm that Convex can use, modify, copy, and
redistribute the contribution, under the terms of its choice.
