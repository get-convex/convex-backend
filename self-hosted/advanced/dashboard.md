## Running the dashboard locally

From the `npm-packages/dashboard-self-hosted` directory, run:

```sh
just rush install
npm run build
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_URL="<your-backend-url>" npm run start
```

## Dashboard optional configuration

- The dashboard uses the **monaco-editor** npm package for all the editor-like
  elements. By default, monaco loads it's core from a CDN. You could configure
  it to load internally by setting the `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOAD_MONACO_INTERNALLY`
  environment variable to `true`
