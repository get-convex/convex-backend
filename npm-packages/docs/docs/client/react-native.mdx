To use Convex in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) use the
[Convex React client library](/docs/client/react.mdx).

Follow the [React Native Quickstart](/docs/quickstart/react-native.mdx) for the
different configuration needed specifically for React Native.

You can also clone a working
[Convex React Native demo](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/react-native).
