This pages covers the Pages Router variant of Next.js. Alternatively see the
[App Router](/docs/client/react/nextjs/nextjs.mdx) version of this page.

## Getting started

Follow the
[Next.js Pages Router Quickstart](/docs/client/react/nextjs-pages-router/quickstart-nextjs-pages-router.mdx)
to add Convex to a new or existing Next.js project.

## Adding client-side authentication

The simplest approach to authentication in Next.js is to keep it client-side.

For example Auth0 describes this approach in
[Next.js Authentication with Auth0 guide](https://auth0.com/blog/ultimate-guide-nextjs-authentication-auth0),
describing it in
"[Next.js Static Site Approach](https://auth0.com/blog/ultimate-guide-nextjs-authentication-auth0/#Next-js-Static-Site-Approach)"
and "Serverless with the user on the frontend".

To require login on every page of your application you can add logic to
`_app.jsx` to conditionally render page content, blocking it until the user is
logged in.

If you're using Auth0, the helper component `ConvexProviderWithAuth0` can be
imported from `convex/react-auth0`.

<Snippet
  title="pages/_app.jsx"
  snippet="simpleAuthedApp"
  source={simpleAuthedAppTSX}
/>

Custom loading and logged out views can be built with the helper
`Authenticated`, `Unauthenticated` and `AuthLoading` components from
`convex/react`, see the
[Convex Next.js demo](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/nextjs-pages-router/pages/_app.jsx)
for an example.

If only some routes of your app require login, the same helpers can be used
directly in page components that do require login instead of being shared
between all pages from `pages/_app.jsx`. Share a single
[ConvexReactClient](/api/classes/react.ConvexReactClient) instance between pages
to avoid needing to reconnect to Convex on client-side page navigation.

Read more about authenticating users with Convex in
[Authentication](/docs/auth.mdx).

## API routes

Next.js supports building HTTP request handling routes, similar to Convex
[HTTP Actions](/docs/functions/http-actions.mdx). Using Next.js routes might be
helpful if you need to use a dependency not supported by the Convex default
runtime.

To build an [API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) add a
file to the `pages/api` directory.

To load and edit Convex data in your endpoints, use the
[`fetchQuery`](/api/modules/nextjs#fetchQuery) function from `convex/nextjs`:

<Snippet title="pages/api/clicks.js" source={apiTS} />

## Server-side rendering

**Consider client-side rendering Convex data when using Next.js.** Data from
Convex is
[fully reactive](/docs/functions/query-functions.mdx#caching-reactivity) so
Convex needs a connection from your deployment to the browser in order to push
updates as data changes.

You can of course load data from Convex in
[`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props)
or
[`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props),
but it will be non-reactive. To do this, use the
[`fetchQuery`](/api/modules/nextjs#fetchQuery) function to call query functions
just like you would in [API routes](#api-routes).

To make authenticated requests to Convex during server-side rendering, you need
authentication info present server-side. Auth0 describes this approach in
[Serverless with the user on the backend](https://auth0.com/blog/ultimate-guide-nextjs-authentication-auth0/#Serverless-with-the-user-on-the-backend).
When server-side rendering, pass the authentication token as `token` to the
third argument of `fetchQuery`.

To preload data on server side before rendering a reactive query on the client
side use [`preloadQuery`](/api/modules/nextjs#preloadquery). Check out the
[App Router version of these docs](/docs/client/react/nextjs/nextjs-server-rendering.mdx)
for more details.
