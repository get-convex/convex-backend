[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is an "approachable, performant and versatile
framework for building web user interfaces."

The community-maintained
[`convex-vue`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convex-vue) npm package is a Vue.js
integration library for Convex. It also powers [convex-nuxt](./vue/nuxt.md).

See the [Vue Quickstart](/quickstart/vue.mdx) to get started or the
[convex-vue GitHub page](https://github.com/chris-visser/convex-vue) for more
documentation.

<Admonition type="info">

The [`convex-vue` library](https://github.com/chris-visser/convex-vue) is
community-maintained. Thank you to the maintainer
[Chris Visser](https://github.com/chris-visser) for his work on this project!

You're welcome to ask questions about the library on the
[Convex Discord](https://convex.dev/community) but opening a
[convex-vue GitHub](https://github.com/chris-visser/convex-vue) issue is a
better way to request a new feature or report a bug.
