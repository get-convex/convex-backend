The [`@convex-vue/core` library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@convex-vue/core)
is community-maintained. Thank you to the maintainer
[loicpennequin](https://github.com/loicpennequin) for his work on this project!

You're welcome to ask questions about the library on the
[Convex Slack](https://convex.dev/community) but opening a
[convex-vue GitHub](https://github.com/loicpennequin/convex-vue/tree/master/packages/convex-vue)
issue is a better way to request a new feature or report a bug.
