[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) is a powerful web framework powered by Vue.

There are two community-maintained Nuxt modules for Convex:

## nuxt-convex

The [`nuxt-convex` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxt-convex)
provides a Nuxt module with file storage composables and Nuxt 4 support.

See the [nuxt-convex documentation](https://nuxt-convex.onmax.me/) or the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/onmax/nuxt-convex) for more information.

## convex-nuxt

The [`convex-nuxt` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convex-nuxt)
provides integration of Convex with the Nuxt 3 ecosystem via suspense for SSR/SSG support.

It uses [convex-vue](../vue.md) under the hood.

See the [Nuxt Quickstart](/quickstart/nuxt.mdx) to get started or the
[convex-nuxt GitHub page](https://github.com/chris-visser/convex-nuxt) for more
documentation.
