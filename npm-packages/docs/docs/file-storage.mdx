File Storage makes it easy to implement file upload in your app, store files
from and send files to third-party APIs, and to serve dynamic files to your
users. All file types are supported.

- [Upload](/file-storage/upload-files.mdx) files to store them in Convex and
  reference them in your database documents
- [Store](/file-storage/store-files.mdx) files generated or fetched from
  third-party APIs
- [Serve](/file-storage/serve-files.mdx) files via URL
- [Delete](/file-storage/delete-files.mdx) files stored in Convex
- Access file [metadata](/file-storage/file-metadata.mdx)

You can manage your stored files on the
[dashboard](/dashboard/deployments/files.md).
