Whether building RAG enabled chatbots or quick search in your applications,
Convex provides easy apis to create powerful AI and search enabled products.

[Vector Search](/search/vector-search.mdx) enables searching for documents based
on their semantic meaning. It uses vector embeddings to calculate similarity and
retrieve documents that are similar to a given query. Vector search is a key
part of common AI techniques like RAG.

[Full Text Search](/search/search.mdx) enables keyword and phrase search within
your documents. It supports both prefix and fuzzy matching. Convex full text
search is also reactive and always up to date like all Convex queries, making it
easy to build reliable quick search boxes.

[Convex Actions](functions/actions) easily enable you to call AI apis, save data
to your database, and drive your user interface. See examples of how you can use
this to [build sophisticated AI applications](https://stack.convex.dev/tag/AI).
