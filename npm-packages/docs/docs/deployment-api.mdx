The public interface of a Convex deployment is defined by the functions defined
in files in a convex folder.

The public HTTP endpoints of every Convex deployment consist of custom HTTP
endpoints defined by [HTTP Actions](/functions/http-actions.mdx) and a static
[public HTTP API](/http-api/index.md).

Deployments also provide private endpoints only for the administrators of that
deployment:

- [Streaming export API](/streaming-export-api.mdx)
- [Streaming import API](/streaming-import-api.mdx)
- [Platform APIs](/deployment-platform-api.mdx)
