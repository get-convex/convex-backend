Convex components add new features to your backend in their own sandbox with
their own functions, schema and data, scheduled functions and all other
fundamental Convex features.

You can see the full list of components in the
[directory](https://convex.dev/components). Each component README provides full
instructions on how to install and use them.

This doc will go through common patterns on how to install and use Components.

## Installing Components

We'll use the
[Sharded Counter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@convex-dev/sharded-counter)
component as an example.

<StepByStep>
  <Step title="Install from `npm`">
  Install the relevant package from npm

```bash
npm i @convex-dev/sharded-counter
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the component to your app">
  Create or update the `convex.config.ts` file in your app's `convex/` folder and install the component by calling `use`:

```ts
// convex/convex.config.ts
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";
import shardedCounter from "@convex-dev/sharded-counter/convex.config";

const app = defineApp();

// highlight-next-line
app.use(shardedCounter);
//... Add other components here

export default app;
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run convex dev">
  Make sure the convex dev cli is running to ensure the component is registered with your backend and the necessary code is generated.

```bash
npx convex dev
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the provided component API">
    Each component has its own API. Check out each component's README file for more details on its usage.
  </Step>

</StepByStep>

## Component functions

Though components may expose higher level TypeScript APIs, under the hood they
are called via normal Convex functions over the component sandbox boundary.

Queries, mutations, and action rules still apply - queries can only call
component queries, mutations can also call component mutations, and actions can
also call component actions. As a result, queries into components are reactive
by default, and mutations have the same transaction guarantees.

Component functions can be called from your application using the following
syntax:

```ts
import { mutation, query } from "./_generated/server";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";

export const abc = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    await ctx.runMutation(components.foo.bar, args);
  },
});
```

This is often abstracted away with functions and methods exposed by the
component's client library. For instance `ShardedCounter` from
`@convex-dev/sharded-counter` is initialized with `components.foo`, and its
methods take in `ctx`.

## Transactions

Remember that mutation functions in Convex are
[transactions](/functions/mutation-functions.mdx#transactions). Either all the
changes in the mutation get written at once or none are written at all.

All writes for a top-level mutation call, including writes performed by calls
into other components' mutations, are committed at the same time. If the
top-level mutation throws an error, all of the writes are rolled back, and the
mutation doesn't change the database at all.

However, if a component mutation call throws an exception, only its writes are
rolled back. Then, if the caller catches the exception, it can continue, perform
more writes, and return successfully. If the caller doesn't catch the exception,
then it's treated as failed and all the writes associated with the caller
mutation are rolled back. This means your code can choose a different code path
depending on the semantics of your component.

As an example, take the
[Rate Limiter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@convex-dev/ratelimiter) component.
One API of the Rate Limiter throws an error if a rate limit is hit:

```ts
// Automatically throw an error if the rate limit is hit.
await rateLimiter.limit(ctx, "failedLogins", { key: userId, throws: true });
```

If the call to `rateLimiter.limit` throws an exception, we're over the rate
limit. Then, if the calling mutation doesn't catch this exception, the whole
transaction is rolled back.

The calling mutation, on the other hand, could also decide to ignore the rate
limit by catching the exception and proceeding. For example, an app may want to
ignore rate limits if there is a development environment override. In this case,
only the component mutation will be rolled back, and the rest of the mutation
will continue.

## Dashboard

You can see your component’s data, functions, files, logs, and other info using
the dropdown in the Dashboard. You can also use the dropdown to exclude info
from certain components.

</p>

## Log Streams

You can use the `data.function.component_path` field in
[log streams](/production/integrations/log-streams) to separate log lines based
on the component they came from.
