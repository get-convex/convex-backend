  "Development workflow from project creation to production deployment"

Let's walk through everything that needs to happen from creating a new project
to launching your app in production.

This doc assumes you are building an app with Convex and React and you already
have a basic React app already up and running. You can follow one of our
[quickstarts](/quickstarts.mdx) to set this up.

## Installing and running Convex

You install Convex adding the npm dependency to your app:

```sh
npm i convex
```

Then you create your Convex project and start the backend dev loop:

```sh
npx convex dev
```

The first time you run the `npx convex dev` command you'll be asked whether you
want start developing locally without an account or create an account.

### Developing without an account

`npx convex dev` will prompt you for the name of your project, and then start
running the open-source Convex backend locally on your machine (this is also
called a "deployment").

The data for your project will be saved in the `~/.convex` directory.

1. The name of your project will get saved to your `.env.local` file so future
   runs of `npx convex dev` will know to use this project.
1. A `convex/` folder will be created (if it doesn't exist), where you'll write
   your Convex backend functions.

You can run `npx convex login` in the future to create an account and link any
existing projects.

### Developing with an account

`npx convex dev` will prompt you through creating an account if one doesn't
exist, and will add your credentials to `~/.convex/config.json` on your machine.
You can run `npx convex logout` to log you machine out of the account in the
future.

Next, `npx convex dev` will create a new project and provision a new personal
development deployment for this project:

1.  Deployment details will automatically be added to your `.env.local` file so
    future runs of `npx convex dev` will know which dev deployment to connect
    to.
1.  A `convex/` folder will be created (if it doesn't exist), where you'll write
    your Convex backend functions.

</div>

## Running the dev loop

Keep the `npx convex dev` command running while you're working on your Convex
app. This continuously pushes backend code you write in the `convex/` folder to
your deployment. It also keeps the necessary TypeScript types up-to-date as you
write your backend code.

When you're developing with a locally running deployment, `npx convex dev` is
also responsible for running your deployment.

You can then add new server functions to your Convex backend:

```typescript title="convex/tasks.ts"
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

// Return the last 100 tasks in a given task list.
export const getTaskList = query({
  args: { taskListId: v.id("taskLists") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const tasks = await ctx.db
      .query("tasks")
      .withIndex("taskListId", (q) => q.eq("taskListId", args.taskListId))
      .order("desc")
      .take(100);
    return tasks;
  },
});
```

When you write and save this code in your editor, several things happen:

1. The `npx convex dev` command typechecks your code and updates the
   `convex/_generated` directory.
1. The contents of your `convex/` directory get uploaded to your dev deployment.
1. Your Convex dev deployment analyzes your code and finds all Convex functions.
   In this example, it determines that `tasks.getTaskList` is a new public query
   function.
1. If there are any changes to the [schema](/database/schemas.mdx), the
   deployment will automatically enforce them.
1. The `npx convex dev` command updates generated TypeScript code in the
   `convex/_generated` directory to provide end to end type safety for your
   functions.

<Admonition type="tip">
  Check in everything in your `convex/_generated/` directory. This it ensures
  that your code immediately type checks and runs without having to first run
  `npx convex dev`. It's particularly useful when non-backend developers are
  writing frontend code and want to ensure their code type checks against
  currently deployed backend code.
</Admonition>

Once this is done you can use your new server function in your frontend:

```typescript title="src/App.tsx"
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

export function App() {
  const data = useQuery(api.tasks.getTaskList);
  return data ?? "Loading...";
}
```

If you have other configuration like [crons](/scheduling/cron-jobs.mdx) or
[auth](/auth.mdx) in your `convex/` folder, Convex ensures that they are applied
and enforced on your backend.

## Convex dashboard

The [Convex dashboard](/dashboard/deployments/deployments.md) will be a trusty
helper throughout your dev, debug and deploy workflow in Convex.

`npx convex dashboard` will open a link to the dashboard for your deployment.

### Logs

Since Convex functions are TypeScript functions you can always use the standard
`console.log` and `console.time` functions to debug your apps.

Logs from your functions show up
[in your dashboard](/dashboard/deployments/logs.md).

### Health, Data, Functions and more

- [Health](/dashboard/deployments/health.md) - provides invaluable information
  on how your app is performing in production, with deep insights on how your
  Convex queries are doing.
- [Data](/dashboard/deployments/data.md) - gives you a complete data browser to
  spot check your data.
- [Functions](/dashboard/deployments/functions.md) - gives you stats and run
  functions to debug them.

There is a lot more to to the dashboard. Be sure to click around or
[check out the docs](/dashboard.md).

## Deploying your app

So far you've been working on your app against your personal dev deployment.

All Convex projects have one production deployment running in the cloud. It has
separate data and has a separate push process from personal dev deployments,
which allows you and your teammates to work on new features using personal dev
deployments without disrupting your app running in production.

If you have not created a Convex account yet, you will need to do so with
`npx convex login`. This will automatically link any projects you've started
with your new account, and enable using your production deployment.

To push your code to your production deployment for your project you run the
deploy command:

```sh
npx convex deploy
```

  If you're running this command for the first time, it will automatically
  provision the prod deployment for your project.
</Admonition>

### Setting up your deployment pipeline

It's rare to run `npx convex deploy` directly. Most production applications run
an automated workflow that runs tests and deploys your backend and frontend
together.

You can see detailed deployment and frontend configuration instructions in the
[Hosting and Deployment](/production/hosting/hosting.mdx) doc. For most React
meta-frameworks Convex
[automatically sets the correct environment variable](/production/hosting/vercel.mdx#how-it-works)
to connect to the production deployment.

## Up next

You now know the basics of how Convex works and fits in your app. Go head and
explore the docs further to learn more about the specific features you want to
use.

Whenever you're ready be sure the read the
[Best Practices](/understanding/best-practices/best-practices.mdx), and then the
[Zen of Convex](/understanding/zen.mdx) once you are ready to "think in Convex."
