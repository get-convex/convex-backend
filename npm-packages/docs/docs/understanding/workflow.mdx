Let's walk through everything that needs to happen from first creating a project
to launching your app in production.

This doc assumes you are working building an app with Convex and React and you
already have a basic React app already up and running. You can always follow one
of our [quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts.mdx) to get up and running quickly.

## Installing and running Convex

You install Convex adding the npm dependency to your app:

```sh
npm i convex
```

Then you create your Convex project and start backend dev loop:

```sh
npx convex dev
```

The first time you run the `npx convex dev` command you'll be asked to:

1. Create an account if it doesn't exist
1. Create a new Convex project if it doesn't exist
1. Provision a new personal development deployment for this project for you
   1. Deployment details will automatically be added to your `.env.local` file
      so future runs of `npx convex dev` will know what dev deployment to
      connect to.
   1. A `convex/` folder will be created (if it doesn't exist), where you'll
      write your Convex backend functions.

</div>

## Developing your app

Keep the `npx convex dev` command running while you're working on your Convex
app. This continuously pushes backend code written in the `convex/` folder to
your dev server. It also keeps the necessary TypeScript types up-to-date as you
write your backend code.

You can then add new new server functions to your Convex backend:

```typescript title="convex/tasks.ts"
import { query } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

// Return the last 100 tasks in a given task list.
export const getTaskList = query({
  args: { taskListId: v.id("taskLists") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const tasks = await ctx.db
      .query("tasks")
      .withIndex("taskListId", (q) => q.eq("taskListId", args.taskListId))
      .order("desc")
      .take(100);
    return tasks;
  },
});
```

When you write and save this code in your editor, several things happen:

1. The `npx convex dev` command uploads the contents of your `convex/` directory
   to your dev deployment.
1. Your Convex dev deployment analyzes your code and finds all Convex functions.
   In this example, it determines that `tasks.getTaskList` is a public query
   function.
1. The `npx convex dev` command updates generated TypeScript code in the
   `convex/_generated` directory to provide end to end type safety for your
   functions.

<Admonition type="tip">
  Check in everything in your `convex/_generated/` directory. This it ensures
  that your code immediately type checks and runs without having to first run
  `npx convex dev`. It's particularly useful for non backend developers on your
  team to write frontend code that type checks against the deployed server
  functions.
</Admonition>

Once this is done you can use your new server function in your frontend:

```typescript title="src/App.tsx"
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

export function App() {
  const data = useQuery(api.tasks.getTaskList);
  return data ?? "Loading...";
}
```

If you have other configuration like schemas, crons, or auth in your `convex/`
folder, Convex ensures that they are applied and enforced on your backend.

## Convex dashboard

The [Convex dashboard](/docs/dashboard/deployments/deployments.md) will be a
trusty helper throughout your dev, debug and deploy workflow in Convex.

### Logs

Since Convex functions are TypeScript functions you can always use the standard
`console.log` and `console.time` functions to debug your apps.

Logs from your functions show up
[in your dashboard](/docs/dashboard/deployments/logs.md).

### Health, Data, Functions and more

- [Health](/docs/dashboard/deployments/health.md) - provides invaluable
  information on how your app is performing in production, with deep insights on
  how your Convex queries are doing.
- [Data](/docs/dashboard/deployments/data.md) - gives you a complete data
  browser to spot check your data.
- [Functions](/docs/dashboard/deployments/functions.md) - gives you stats and
  run functions to debug them.

There is a lot more to to the dashboard. Be sure to click around or
[check out the docs](/docs/dashboard.md).

## Deploying your app

So far you've been working on your app against your personal dev deployment for
the current project.

All projects have one production deployment. It has separate data and has a
separate push process from personal dev deployments, which allows you and your
teammates to work on new features using personal dev deployments without
disrupting your app running in production.

To push your code to your production deployment for your project you run the
deploy command:

```sh
npx convex deploy
```

<Admonition type="info">
  If you're running this command for the first time, it will automatically
  provision the prod deployment for your project.
</Admonition>

### Setting up your deployment pipeline

It's rare to run `npx convex deploy` directly. Most production applications run
an automated workflow that runs tests and deploys your backend and frontend
together.

You can see detailed deployment and frontend configuration instructions in the
[Hosting and Deployment](/docs/production/hosting/hosting.mdx) doc. For most
React meta-frameworks Convex
[automatically sets the correct environment variable](/docs/production/hosting/vercel.mdx#how-it-works)
to connect to the production deployment.

## Up next

You now know the basics of how Convex works and fits in your app. Go head and
explore the docs further to learn more about the specific features you want to
use.

Whenever you're ready be sure the read the
[Best Practices](/docs/understanding/best-practices/best-practices.mdx), and
then the [Zen of Convex](/docs/understanding/zen.mdx) once you are ready to
"think in Convex."
