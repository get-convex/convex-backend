Convex provides end-to-end type support when Convex functions are written in
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

You can gradually add TypeScript to a Convex project: the following steps
provide progressively better type support. For the best support you'll want to
complete them all.

**Example:**
[TypeScript and Schema](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/typescript)

## Writing Convex functions in TypeScript

The first step to improving type support in a Convex project is to writing your
Convex functions in TypeScript by using the `.ts` extension.

If you are using [argument validation](/functions/validation.mdx), Convex will
infer the types of your functions arguments automatically:

<Snippet title="convex/sendMessage.ts" source={ArgValidation} />

Otherwise you can annotate the arguments type manually:

<Snippet
  title="convex/sendMessage.ts"
  source={WithoutArgValidation}
  highlightPatterns={["body: string"]}
/>

This can be useful for [internal functions](/functions/internal-functions.mdx)
accepting complicated types.

If TypeScript is installed in your project `npx convex dev` and
`npx convex deploy` will typecheck Convex functions before sending code to the
Convex backend.

Convex functions are typechecked with the `tsconfig.json` in the Convex folder:
you can modify some parts of this file to change typechecking settings, or
delete this file to disable this typecheck.

You'll find most database methods have a return type of `Promise<any>` until you
add a schema.

## Adding a schema

Once you [define a schema](/database/schemas.mdx) the type signature of database
methods will be known. You'll also be able to use types imported from
`convex/_generated/dataModel` in both Convex functions and clients written in
TypeScript (React, React Native, Node.js etc.).

The types of documents in tables can be described using the
[`Doc`](/generated-api/data-model#doc) type from the generated data model and
references to documents can be described with parametrized
[Document IDs](/database/document-ids.mdx).

<Snippet title="convex/messages.ts" source={WithSchema} />

## Type annotating server-side helpers

When you want to reuse logic across Convex functions you'll want to define
helper TypeScript functions, and these might need some of the provided context,
to access the database, authentication and any other Convex feature.

Convex generates types corresponding to documents and IDs in your database,
`Doc` and `Id`, as well as `QueryCtx`, `MutationCtx` and `ActionCtx` types based
on your schema and declared Convex functions:

<Snippet title="convex/helpers.ts" source={ContextTypes} />

### Inferring types from validators

Validators can be reused between
[argument validation](/functions/validation.mdx) and
[schema validation](/database/schemas.mdx). You can use the provided
[`Infer`](/api/modules/values#infer) type to get a TypeScript type corresponding
to a validator:

<Snippet title="convex/helpers.ts" source={ValidatorTypes} />

### Document types without system fields

All documents in Convex include the built-in `_id` and `_creationTime` fields,
and so does the generated `Doc` type. When creating or updating a document you
might want use the type without the system fields. Convex provides
[`WithoutSystemFields`](/api/modules/server#withoutsystemfields) for this
purpose:

<Snippet title="convex/helpers.ts" source={SystemFieldsTypes} />

## Writing frontend code in TypeScript

All Convex JavaScript clients, including React hooks like
[`useQuery`](/api/modules/react#usequery) and
[`useMutation`](/api/modules/react#usemutation) provide end to end type safety
by ensuring that arguments and return values match the corresponding Convex
functions declarations. For React, install and configure TypeScript so you can
write your React components in `.tsx` files instead of `.jsx` files.

Follow our [React](/quickstart/react.mdx) or [Next.js](/quickstart/nextjs.mdx)
quickstart to get started with Convex and TypeScript.

### Type annotating client-side code

When you want to pass the result of calling a function around your client
codebase, you can use the generated types `Doc` and `Id`, just like on the
backend:

<Snippet title="src/App.tsx" source={ClientDatabaseTypes} />

You can also declare custom types inside your backend codebase which include
`Doc`s and `Id`s, and import them in your client-side code.

You can also use `WithoutSystemFields` and any types inferred from validators
via `Infer`.

#### Using inferred function return types

Sometimes you might want to annotate a type on the client based on whatever your
backend function returns. Beside manually declaring the type (on the backend or
on the frontend), you can use the generic `FunctionReturnType` and
`UsePaginatedQueryReturnType` types with a function reference:

<Snippet title="src/Components.tsx" source={FunctionReturnTypes} />

## Turning `string`s into valid document IDs

See [Serializing IDs](/database/document-ids.mdx#serializing-ids).

## Required TypeScript version

Convex requires TypeScript version
[5.0.3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript/v/5.0.3) or newer.
