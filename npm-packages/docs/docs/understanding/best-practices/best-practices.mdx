This is a list of best practices and common anti-patterns around using Convex.
We recommend going through this list before broadly releasing your app to
production. You may choose to try using all of these best practices from the
start, or you may wait until you've gotten major parts of your app working
before going through and adopting the best practices here.

## Await all Promises

### Why?

Convex functions use async / await. If you don't await all your promises (e.g.
`await ctx.scheduler.runAfter`, `await ctx.db.patch`), you may run into
unexpected behavior (e.g. failing to schedule a function) or miss handling
errors.

### How?

We recommend the
[no-floating-promises](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-floating-promises/)
eslint rule with TypeScript.

## Avoid `.filter` on database queries

### Why?

Filtering in code instead of using the `.filter` syntax has the same
performance, and is generally easier code to write. Conditions in `.withIndex`
or `.withSearchIndex` are more efficient than `.filter` or filtering in code, so
almost all uses of `.filter` should either be replaced with a `.withIndex` or
`.withSearchIndex` condition, or written as TypeScript code.

Read through the
[indexes documentation](/docs/database/reading-data/indexes/indexes-and-query-perf.md)
for an overview of how to define indexes and how they work.

### Examples

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/messages.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="filter"
/>

### How?

Search for `.filter` in your Convex codebase — a regex like `\.filter\(\(?q`
will probably find all the ones on database queries.

Decide whether they should be replaced with a `.withIndex` condition — per
[this section](/docs/understanding/best-practices/best-practices.mdx#only-use-collect-with-a-small-number-of-results),
if you are filtering over a large (1000+) or potentially unbounded number of
documents, you should use an index. If not using a `.withIndex` /
`.withSearchIndex` condition, consider replacing them with a filter in code for
more readability and flexibility.

See [this article](https://stack.convex.dev/complex-filters-in-convex) for more
strategies for filtering.

### Exceptions

Using `.filter` on a paginated query (`.paginate`) has advantages over filtering
in code. The paginated query will return the number of documents requested,
including the `.filter` condition, so filtering in code afterwards can result in
a smaller page or even an empty page. Using `.withIndex` on a paginated query
will still be more efficient than a `.filter`.

## Only use `.collect` with a small number of results

### Why?

All results returned from `.collect` count towards database bandwidth (even ones
filtered out by `.filter`). It also means that if any document in the result
changes, the query will re-run or the mutation will hit a conflict.

If there's a chance the number of results is large (say 1000+ documents), you
should use an index to filter the results further before calling `.collect`, or
find some other way to avoid loading all the documents such as using pagination,
denormalizing data, or changing the product feature.

### Example

**Using an index:**

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/movies.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="collectIndex"
/>

**Using pagination:**

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/movies.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="collectPaginate"
/>

**Using a limit or denormalizing:**

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/movies.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="collectCount"
/>

### How?

Search for `.collect` in your Convex codebase (a regex like `\.collect\(` will
probably find these). And think through whether the number of results is small.
This function health page in the dashboard can also help surface these.

The [aggregate component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@convex-dev/aggregate)
or [database triggers](https://stack.convex.dev/triggers) can be helpful
patterns for denormalizing data.

### Exceptions

If you're doing something that requires loading a large number of documents
(e.g. performing a migration, making a summary), you may want to use an action
to load them in batches via separate queries / mutations.

## Check for redundant indexes

### Why?

Indexes like `by_foo` and `by_foo_and_bar` are usually redundant (you only need
`by_foo_and_bar`). Reducing the number of indexes saves on database storage and
reduces the overhead of writing to the table.

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/teams.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="redundantIndexes"
  replacements={[[/\sOMIT_ME.*/g, ""]]}
/>

### How?

Look through your indexes, either in your `schema.ts` file or in the dashboard,
and look for any indexes where one is a prefix of another.

### Exceptions

`.index("by_foo", ["foo"])` is really an index on the properties `foo` and
`_creationTime`, while `.index("by_foo_and_bar", ["foo", "bar"])` is an index on
the properties `foo`, `bar`, and `_creationTime`. If you have queries that need
to be sorted by `foo` and then `_creationTime`, then you need both indexes.

For example, `.index("by_channel", ["channel"])` on a table of messages can be
used to query for the most recent messages in a channel, but
`.index("by_channel_and_author", ["channel", "author"])` could not be used for
this since it would first sort the messages by `author`.

## Use argument validators for all public functions

### Why?

Public functions can be called by anyone, including potentially malicious
attackers trying to break your app.
[Argument validators](/docs/functions/validation.mdx) (as well as return value
validators) help ensure you're getting the traffic you expect.

### Example

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/messages.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="validation"
  replacements={[[/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""]]}
/>

### How?

Search for `query`, `mutation`, and `action` in your Convex codebase, and ensure
that all of them have argument validators (and optionally return value
validators). If you have `httpAction`s, you may want to use something like `zod`
to validate that the HTTP request is the shape you expect.

## Use some form of access control for all public functions

### Why?

Public functions can be called by anyone, including potentially malicious
attackers trying to break your app. If portions of your app should only be
accessible when the user is signed in, make sure all these Convex functions
check that `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` is set.

You may also have specific checks, like only loading messages that were sent to
or from the current user, which you'll want to apply in every relevant public
function.

Favoring more granular functions like `setTeamOwner` over `updateTeam` allows
more granular checks for which users can do what.

Access control checks should either use `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` or a
function argument that is unguessable (e.g. a UUID, or a Convex ID, provided
that this ID is never exposed to any client but the one user). In particular,
don't use a function argument which could be spoofed (e.g. email) for access
control checks.

### Example

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/teams.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="accessControl"
  replacements={[
    [/\sOMIT_ME.*/g, ""],
    [/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""],
  ]}
/>

### How?

Search for `query`, `mutation`, `action`, and `httpAction` in your Convex
codebase, and ensure that all of them have some form of access control.
[Custom functions](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-helpers/blob/main/packages/convex-helpers/README.md#custom-functions)
like
[`authenticatedQuery`](https://stack.convex.dev/custom-functions#modifying-the-ctx-argument-to-a-server-function-for-user-auth)
can be helpful.

Some apps use Row Level Security (RLS) to check access to each document
automatically whenever it's loaded, as described in
[this article](https://stack.convex.dev/row-level-security). Alternatively, you
can check access in each Convex function instead of checking access for each
document.

Helper functions for common checks and common operations can also be useful --
e.g. `isTeamMember`, `isTeamAdmin`, `loadTeam` (which throws if the current user
does not have access to the team).

## Only schedule and `ctx.run*` internal functions

### Why?

Public functions can be called by anyone, including potentially malicious
attackers trying to break your app, and should be carefully audited to ensure
they can't be used maliciously. Functions that are only called within Convex can
be marked as internal, and relax these checks since Convex will ensure that
internal functions can only be called within Convex.

### How?

Search for `ctx.runQuery`, `ctx.runMutation`, and `ctx.runAction` in your Convex
codebase. Also search for `ctx.scheduler` and check the `crons.ts` file. Ensure
all of these use `internal.foo.bar` functions instead of `api.foo.bar`
functions.

If you have code you want to share between a public Convex function and an
internal Convex function, create a helper function that can be called from both.
The public function will likely have additional access control checks.

Alternatively, make sure that `api` from `_generated/api.ts` is never used in
your Convex functions directory.

### Examples

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/teams.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="internal"
  replacements={[
    [/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""],
    [
      "// REPLACE_WITH_MUTATION_CTX_IMPORT",
      "import { MutationCtx } from './_generated/server';",
    ],
  ]}
/>

## Use helper functions to write shared code

### Why?

Most logic should be written as plain TypeScript functions, with the `query`,
`mutation`, and `action` wrapper functions being a thin wrapper around one or
more helper function.

Concretely, most of your code should live in a directory like `convex/model`,
and your public API, which is defined with `query`, `mutation`, and `action`,
should have very short functions that mostly just call into `convex/model`.

Organizing your code this way makes several of the refactors mentioned in this
list easier to do.

See the [TypeScript page](/docs/understanding/best-practices/typescript.mdx) for
useful types.

### Example

**❌** This example overuses `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation`, which is
discussed more in the
[Avoid sequential `ctx.runMutation` / `ctx.runQuery` from actions](/docs/understanding/best-practices/best-practices.mdx#avoid-sequential-ctx-runmutation-ctx-runquery-from-actions)
section.

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/users.ts"
  sourceTS={HelperFunctionsTS}
  sourceJS={HelperFunctionsTS}
  snippet="usersWrong"
  replacements={[
    [/\sOMIT_ME.*/g, ""],
    [/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""],
  ]}
/>

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/conversations.ts"
  sourceTS={HelperFunctionsTS}
  sourceJS={HelperFunctionsTS}
  snippet="conversationsWrong"
  replacements={[
    [/\sOMIT_ME.*/g, ""],
    [/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""],
  ]}
/>

**✅** Most of the code here is now in the `convex/model` directory. The API for
this application is in `convex/conversations.ts`, which contains very little
code itself.

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/model/users.ts"
  sourceTS={HelperFunctionsTS}
  sourceJS={HelperFunctionsTS}
  snippet="usersCorrect"
  replacements={[
    [/\sOMIT_ME.*/g, ""],
    [/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""],
  ]}
  prefix={`import { QueryCtx } from '../_generated/server';\n`}
/>

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/model/conversations.ts"
  sourceTS={HelperFunctionsTS}
  sourceJS={HelperFunctionsTS}
  snippet="conversationsModelCorrect"
  replacements={[
    [/\sOMIT_ME.*/g, ""],
    [/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""],
  ]}
  prefix={`import { QueryCtx, MutationCtx } from '../_generated/server';\nimport * as Users from './users';\n`}
/>

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/conversations.ts"
  sourceTS={HelperFunctionsTS}
  sourceJS={HelperFunctionsTS}
  snippet="conversationsApiCorrect"
  replacements={[
    [/\sOMIT_ME.*/g, ""],
    [/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""],
  ]}
  prefix={`import * as Conversations from './model/conversations';\n`}
/>

## Use `runAction` only when using a different runtime

### Why?

Calling `runAction` has more overhead than calling a plain TypeScript function.
It counts as an extra function call with its own memory and CPU usage, while the
parent action is doing nothing except waiting for the result. Therefore,
`runAction` should almost always be replaced with calling a plain TypeScript
function. However, if you want to call code that requires Node.js from a
function in the Convex runtime (e.g. using a library that requires Node.js),
then you can use `runAction` to call the Node.js code.

### Example

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/scrape.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="runAction"
  replacements={[
    [/\sOMIT_ME.*/g, ""],
    [/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""],
  ]}
/>

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/model/scrape.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="scrapeModel"
  prefix={`import { ActionCtx } from '../_generated/server';\n`}
  replacements={[
    [/\sOMIT_ME.*/g, ""],
    [/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""],
  ]}
/>

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/scrape.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="scrapeAction"
  prefix={`import * as Scrape from './model/scrape';\n`}
  replacements={[
    [/\sOMIT_ME.*/g, ""],
    [/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""],
  ]}
/>

### How?

Search for `runAction` in your Convex codebase, and see if the function it calls
uses the same runtime as the parent function. If so, replace the `runAction`
with a plain TypeScript function. You may want to structure your functions so
the Node.js functions are in a separate directory so it's easier to spot these.

## Avoid sequential `ctx.runMutation` / `ctx.runQuery` calls from actions

### Why?

Each `ctx.runMutation` or `ctx.runQuery` runs in its own transaction, which
means if they're called separately, they may not be consistent with each other.
If instead we call a single `ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation`, we're
guaranteed that the results we get are consistent.

### How?

Audit your calls to `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation` in actions. If you see
multiple in a row with no other code between them, replace them with a single
`ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation` that handles both things. Refactoring your
code to use helper functions will make this easier.

### Example: Queries

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/teams.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="runQueryWrong"
/>

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/teams.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="runQueryCorrect"
  prefix={`import * as Teams from './model/teams';\nimport * as Users from './model/users';\n`}
/>

### Example: Loops

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/teams.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="runMutationWrong"
  prefix={`import * as Users from './model/users';\n`}
  replacements={[
    [/\sOMIT_ME.*/g, ""],
    [/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""],
  ]}
/>

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/teams.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="runMutationCorrect"
  prefix={`import * as Users from './model/users';\n`}
  replacements={[
    [/\sOMIT_ME.*/g, ""],
    [/_OMIT_[0-9]+/g, ""],
  ]}
/>

### Exceptions

If you're intentionally trying to process more data than fits in a single
transaction, like running a migration or aggregating data, then it makes sense
to have multiple sequential `ctx.runMutation` / `ctx.runQuery` calls.

Multiple `ctx.runQuery` / `ctx.runMutation` calls are often necessary because
the action does a side effect in between them. For example, reading some data,
feeding it to an external service, and then writing the result back to the
database.

## Use `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation` sparingly in queries and mutations

### Why?

While these queries and mutations run in the same transaction, and will give
consistent results, they have extra overhead compared to plain TypeScript
functions. Wanting a TypeScript helper function is much more common than needing
`ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation`.

### How?

Audit your calls to `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation` in queries and
mutations. Unless one of the exceptions below applies, replace them with a plain
TypeScript function.

### Exceptions

- If you're using components, these require `ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation`.
- If you want partial rollback on an error, you will want `ctx.runMutation`
  instead of a plain TypeScript function.

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/messages.ts"
  sourceTS={BestPracticesTS}
  sourceJS={BestPracticesTS}
  snippet="partialRollback"
/>
