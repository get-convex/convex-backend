Functions run on the backend and are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript). They
are automatically available as APIs accessed through
[client libraries](/docs/client/react.mdx). Everything you do in the Convex
backend starts from functions.

There are three types of functions:

- [Queries](/docs/functions/query-functions.mdx) read data from your Convex
  database and are automatically cached and subscribable (realtime, reactive).
- [Mutations](/functions/mutation-functions.mdx) write data to the database and
  run as a transaction.
- [Actions](/functions/actions.mdx) can call OpenAI, Stripe, Twilio, or any
  other service or API you need to make your app work.

You can also build [HTTP actions](/docs/functions/http-actions.mdx) when you
want to call your functions from a webhook or a custom client.

Here's an overview of the three different types of Convex functions and what
they can do:

|                            | Queries | Mutations | Actions |
| -------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Database access            | Yes     | Yes       | No      |
| Transactional              | Yes     | Yes       | No      |
| Cached                     | Yes     | No        | No      |
| Real-time Updates          | Yes     | No        | No      |
| External API Calls (fetch) | No      | No        | Yes     |
