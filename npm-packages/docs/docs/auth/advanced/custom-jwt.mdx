**Note: This is an advanced feature!** We recommend sticking with the
[supported third-party authentication providers](/auth.mdx).

If your custom auth provider implements the OIDC protocol it's easiest to
configure a [Custom OIDC Provider](/auth/advanced/custom-auth). However some
auth providers only issue JWTs and don't participate in the full OIDC protocol.
For example, [OpenAuth](https://openauth.js.org/) implements the OAuth 2.0 spec
but not OIDC, so to use it with Convex you'll need to set it up as a Custom JWT
provider.

The JWT must contain at least the `sub`, `iss`, `iat`, and `exp` fields.

## Server-side integration

Use `type: "customJwt"` to configure a Custom JWT auth provider:

```js noDialect title="convex/auth.config.js"
export default {
  providers: [
    {
      type: "customJwt",
      applicationID: "your-application-id",
      issuer: "https://your.issuer.url.com",
      jwks: "https://your.issuer.url.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
      algorithm: "RS256",
    },
  ],
};
```

- `applicationID` (optional): If provided, Convex will verify that JWTs have
  this value in the `aud` claim.
- `issuer`: The issuer URL of the JWT.
- `jwks`: The URL for fetching the JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) from the auth
  provider.
- `algorithm`: The algorithm used to sign the JWT. Only RS256 and ES256 are
  currently supported. See
  [RFC 7518](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7518#section-3.1) for more
  details.

The `issuer` property must exactly match the `iss` field of the JWT used and if
specified the `applicationID` property must exactly match the `aud` field. If
your JWT doesn't match, use a tool like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to view an JWT
and confirm these fields match exactly.

When adding a custom JWT provider it is your responsibility to ensure the fields
uniquely identify a user; for example, if the `iss` field and `issuer` property
do not uniquely identify your app, it's important to use the `applicationID`
field as well to require the `aud` field to match.

### Custom claims

In addition to top-level fields like `subject`, `issuer`, and `tokenIdentifier`,
subfields of the nested fields of the JWT will be accessible in the auth data
returned from `const authInfo = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` like
`authInfo["properties.id"]` and `authInfo["properties.favoriteColor"]` for a JWT
structured like this:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "id": "123",
    "favoriteColor": "red"
  },
  "iss": "http://localhost:3000",
  "sub": "user:8fa2be73c2229e85",
  "exp": 1750968478
}
```

## Client-side integration

Your user's browser needs a way to obtain an initial JWT and to request updated
JWTs, ideally before the previous one expires.

See the instructions for
[Custom OIDC Providers](/auth/advanced/custom-auth#client-side-integration) for
how to do this.
