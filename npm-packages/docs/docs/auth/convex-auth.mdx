[Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth) is a library for implementing
authentication directly within your Convex backend. This allows you to
authenticate users without needing an authentication service or even a hosting
server. Convex Auth currently supports client-side React web apps served from a
CDN and React Native mobile apps.

**Example:** [Live Demo](https://labs.convex.dev/auth-example)

Support for
[authentication in Next.js](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/authz/nextjs) server
components, API routes, middleware, SSR etc. is under active development. If
you'd like to help test this experimental support please
[let us know how it goes in Discord](https://convex.dev/community).

## Get Started

To start a new project from scratch with Convex and Convex Auth, run:

```sh
npm create convex@latest
```

and choose `React (Vite)` and `Convex Auth`.

To add Convex Auth to an existing project, follow the full
[setup guide](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/setup).

## Overview

Convex Auth enables you to implement the following authentication methods:

1. Magic Links & OTPs - send a link or code via email
2. OAuth - sign in with Github / Google / Apple etc.
3. Passwords - including password reset flow and optional email verification

The library doesn't come with UI components, but you can copy code from the docs
and example repo to quickly build a UI in React.

Learn more in the [Convex Auth docs](https://labs.convex.dev/auth).
