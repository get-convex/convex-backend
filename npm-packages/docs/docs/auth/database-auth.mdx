_If you're using [Convex Auth](/docs/auth/convex-auth.mdx) the user information
is already stored in your database. There's nothing else you need to implement._

You might want to store user information directly in your Convex database, for
the following reasons:

- Your functions need information about other users, not just about the
  currently logged-in user
- Your functions need access to information other than the fields available in
  the [Open ID Connect JWT](/docs/auth/functions-auth.mdx)

There are two ways you can choose from for storing user information in your
database (but only the second one allows storing information not contained in
the JWT):

1. Have your app's [client call a mutation](#call-a-mutation-from-the-client)
   that stores the information from the JWT available on
   [`ctx.auth`](/api/interfaces/server.Auth)
2. [Implement a webhook](#set-up-webhooks) and have your identity provider call
   it whenever user information changes

## Call a mutation from the client

**Example:**
[Convex Authentication with Clerk](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/users-and-clerk)

### (optional) Users table schema

You can define a `"users"` table, optionally with an
[index](/docs/database/reading-data/indexes/indexes.md) for efficient looking up
the users in the database.

In the examples below we will use the `tokenIdentifier` from the
`ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` to identify the user, but you could use the
`subject` field (which is usually set to the unique user ID from your auth
provider) or even `email`, if your authentication provider provides email
verification and you have it enabled.

Which field you use will determine how multiple providers interact, and how hard
it will be to migrate to a different provider.

<Snippet source={Schema} snippet="user" title="convex/schema.ts" />

### Mutation for storing current user

This is an example of a mutation that stores the user's `name` and
`tokenIdentifier`:

<TSAndJSSnippet sourceTS={UsersTS} sourceJS={UsersTS} title="convex/users.js" />

### Calling the store user mutation from React

You can call this mutation when the user logs in from a `useEffect` hook. After
the mutation succeeds you can update local state to reflect that the user has
been stored.

This helper hook that does the job:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={useStoreUserEffectTS}
  sourceJS={useStoreUserEffectJS}
  title="src/useStoreUserEffect.ts"
/>

You can use this hook in your top-level component. If your queries need the user
document to be present, make sure that you only render the components that call
them after the user has been stored:

<TSAndJSSnippet sourceTS={App} sourceJS={App} title="src/App.tsx" />

In this way the `useStoreUserEffect` hook replaces the `useConvexAuth` hook.

### Using the current user's document ID

Similarly to the store user mutation, you can retrieve the current user's ID, or
throw an error if the user hasn't been stored.

Now that you have users stored as documents in your Convex database, you can use
their IDs as foreign keys in other documents:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={MessagesTS}
  sourceJS={MessagesTS}
  snippet="load-user"
  title="convex/messages.ts"
  suffix={`    // do something with \`user\`...
  }
});`}
/>

### Loading users by their ID

The information about other users can be retrieved via their IDs:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={MessagesTS}
  sourceJS={MessagesTS}
  snippet="use-users"
  title="convex/messages.ts"
  prefix={`import { query } from "./_generated/server";
`}
/>

## Set up webhooks

This guide will use Clerk, but Auth0 can be set up similarly via
[Auth0 Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview).

With this implementation Clerk will call your Convex backend via an HTTP
endpoint any time a user signs up, updates or deletes their account.

**Example:**
[Convex Authentication with Clerk and Webhooks](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/users-and-clerk-webhooks)

### Configure the webhook endpoint in Clerk

On your Clerk dashboard, go to _Webhooks_, click on _+ Add Endpoint_.

Set _Endpoint URL_ to
`https://<your deployment name>.convex.site/clerk-users-webhook` (note the
domain ends in **`.site`**, not `.cloud`). You can see your deployment name in
the `.env.local` file in your project directory, or on your Convex dashboard as
part of the [Deployment URL](/docs/dashboard/deployments/settings.md). For
example, the endpoint URL could be:
`https://happy-horse-123.convex.site/clerk-users-webhook`.

In _Message Filtering_, select **user** for all user events (scroll down or use
the search input).

Click on _Create_.

After the endpoint is saved, copy the _Signing Secret_ (on the right side of the
UI), it should start with `whsec_`. Set it as the value of the
`CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable in your Convex
[dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev).

### (optional) Users table schema

You can define a `"users"` table, optionally with an
[index](/docs/database/reading-data/indexes/indexes.md) for efficient looking up
the users in the database.

In the examples below we will use the `subject` from the
`ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` to identify the user, which should be set to the
Clerk user ID.

<Snippet source={WebhooksSchema} snippet="table" title="convex/schema.ts" />

### Mutations for upserting and deleting users

This is an example of mutations that handle the updates received via the
webhook:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={WebhookMutations}
  sourceJS={WebhookMutations}
  title="convex/users.ts"
/>

There are also a few helpers in this file:

- `current` exposes the user information to the client, which will helps the
  client determine whether the webhook already succeeded
- `upsertFromClerk` will be called when a user signs up or when they update
  their account
- `deleteFromClerk` will be called when a user deletes their account via Clerk
  UI from your app
- `getCurrentUserOrThrow` retrieves the currently logged-in user or throws an
  error
- `getCurrentUser` retrieves the currently logged-in user or returns null
- `userByExternalId` retrieves a user given the Clerk ID, and is used only for
  retrieving the current user or when updating an existing user via the webhook

### Webhook endpoint implementation

This how the actual HTTP endpoint can be implemented:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={WebhookEndpoint}
  sourceJS={WebhookEndpoint}
  title="convex/http.ts"
/>

If you deploy your code now and sign in, you should see the user being created
in your Convex database.

### Using the current user's document

You can use the helpers defined before to retrieve the current user's document.

Now that you have users stored as documents in your Convex database, you can use
their IDs as foreign keys in other documents:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={WebhookMessages}
  sourceJS={WebhookMessages}
  snippet="current-user"
  title="convex/messages.ts"
/>

### Loading users by their ID

The information about other users can be retrieved via their IDs:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={MessagesTS}
  sourceJS={MessagesTS}
  snippet="use-users"
  title="convex/messages.ts"
/>

### Waiting for current user to be stored

If you want to use the current user's document in a query, make sure that the
user has already been stored. You can do this by explicitly checking for this
condition before rendering the components that call the query, or before
redirecting to the authenticated portion of your app.

For example you can define a hook that determines the current authentication
state of the client, taking into account whether the current user has been
stored:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={WebhookHook}
  sourceJS={WebhookHook}
  title="src/useCurrentUser.ts"
/>

And then you can use it to render the appropriate components:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={WebhookClient}
  sourceJS={WebhookClient}
  snippet="client-blocking"
  title="src/App.tsx"
/>
