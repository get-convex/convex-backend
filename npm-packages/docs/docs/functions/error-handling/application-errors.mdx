import Server from "!!raw-loader!@site/../private-demos/snippets/convex/applicationErrors.ts";
import ClientTS from "!!raw-loader!@site/../private-demos/snippets/src/applicationErrors.tsx";
import ClientJS from "!!raw-loader!@site/../private-demos/snippets/src/applicationErrorsJS.jsx";

If you have expected ways your functions might fail, you can either return
different values or throw `ConvexError`s.

## Returning different values

If you're using TypeScript different return types can enforce that you're
handling error scenarios.

For example, a `createUser` mutation could return

```ts
Id<"users"> | { error: "EMAIL_ADDRESS_IN_USE" };
```

to express that either the mutation succeeded or the email address was already
taken.

This ensures that you remember to handle these cases in your UI.

## Throwing application errors

You might prefer to throw errors for the following reasons:

- You can use the exception bubbling mechanism to throw from a deeply nested
  function call, instead of manually propagating error results up the call
  stack. This will work for `runQuery`, `runMutation` and `runAction` calls in
  [actions](/docs/functions/actions.mdx) too.
- In [mutations](/docs/functions/mutation-functions.mdx), throwing an error will
  prevent the mutation transaction from committing
- On the client, it might be simpler to handle all kinds of errors, both
  expected and unexpected, uniformly

Convex provides an error subclass,
[`ConvexError`](/api/classes/values.ConvexError), which can be used to carry
information from the backend to the client:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="convex/myFunctions.ts"
  sourceTS={Server}
  sourceJS={Server}
  snippet="example"
  highlightPatterns={["ConvexError"]}
/>

### Application error `data` payload

You can pass the same [data types](/docs/database/types.md) supported by
function arguments, return types and the database, to the `ConvexError`
constructor. This data will be stored on the `data` property of the error:

```ts
// error.data === "My fancy error message"
throw new ConvexError("My fancy error message");

// error.data === {message: "My fancy error message", code: 123, severity: "high"}
throw new ConvexError({
  message: "My fancy error message",
  code: 123,
  severity: "high",
});

// error.data === {code: 123, severity: "high"}
throw new ConvexError({
  code: 123,
  severity: "high",
});
```

Error payloads more complicated than a simple `string` are helpful for more
structured error logging, or for handling sets of errors differently on the
client.

## Handling application errors on the client

On the client, application errors also use the `ConvexError` class, and the data
they carry can be accessed via the `data` property:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  title="src/App.tsx"
  sourceTS={ClientTS}
  sourceJS={ClientJS}
  highlightPatterns={["ConvexError", ".data"]}
/>
