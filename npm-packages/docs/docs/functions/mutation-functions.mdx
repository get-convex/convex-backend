Mutations insert, update and remove data from the database, check authentication
or perform other business logic, and optionally return a response to the client
application.

This is an example mutation, taking in named arguments, writing data to the
database and returning a result:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={Example}
  sourceJS={Example}
  title="convex/myFunctions.ts"
/>

Read on to understand how to build mutations yourself.

## Mutation names

Mutations follow the same naming rules as queries, see
[Query names](/functions/query-functions.mdx#query-names).

Queries and mutations can be defined in the same file when using named exports.

## The `mutation` constructor

To declare a mutation in Convex use the `mutation` constructor function. Pass it
an object with a `handler` function, which performs the mutation:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={Constructor}
  sourceJS={Constructor}
  title="convex/myFunctions.ts"
/>

Unlike a query, a mutation can but does not have to return a value.

### Mutation arguments

Just like queries, mutations accept named arguments, and the argument values are
accessible as fields of the second parameter of the `handler` function:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={ArgsWithoutValidationTS}
  sourceJS={ArgsWithoutValidationJS}
  title="convex/myFunctions.ts"
/>

Arguments and responses are automatically serialized and deserialized, and you
can pass and return most value-like JavaScript data to and from your mutation.

To both declare the types of arguments and to validate them, add an `args`
object using `v` validators:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={ArgsWithValidation}
  sourceJS={ArgsWithValidation}
  title="convex/myFunctions.ts"
/>

See [argument validation](/functions/validation.mdx) for the full list of
supported types and validators.

The first parameter to the handler function is reserved for the mutation
context.

### Mutation responses

Queries can return values of any supported
[Convex type](/functions/validation.mdx) which will be automatically serialized
and deserialized.

Mutations can also return `undefined`, which is not a valid Convex value. When a
mutation returns `undefined` **it is translated to `null`** on the client.

### Mutation context

The `mutation` constructor enables writing data to the database, and other
Convex features by passing a [MutationCtx](/generated-api/server.md#mutationctx)
object to the handler function as the first parameter:

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={Context}
  sourceJS={Context}
  title="convex/myFunctions.ts"
/>

Which part of the mutation context is used depends on what your mutation needs
to do:

- To read from and write to the database use the `db` field. Note that we make
  the handler function an `async` function so we can `await` the promise
  returned by `db.insert()`:

  <TSAndJSSnippet
    sourceTS={ContextDB}
    sourceJS={ContextDB}
    title="convex/myFunctions.ts"
  />

  Read on about [Writing Data](/database/writing-data.mdx).

- To generate upload URLs for storing files use the `storage` field. Read on
  about [File Storage](/file-storage.mdx).
- To check user authentication use the `auth` field. Read on about
  [Authentication](/auth.mdx).
- To schedule functions to run in the future, use the `scheduler` field. Read on
  about [Scheduled Functions](/scheduling/scheduled-functions.mdx).

## Splitting up mutation code via helpers

<>
  {/* Fragment for Prettier */}
  When you want to split up the code in your mutation or reuse logic across
  multiple Convex functions you can define and call helper
  <LanguageSelector verbose /> functions:
</>

<TSAndJSSnippet
  sourceTS={Helper}
  sourceJS={HelperJS}
  title="convex/myFunctions.ts"
/>

Mutations can call helpers that take a
[QueryCtx](/generated-api/server.md#queryctx) as argument, since the mutation
context can do everything query context can.

You can `export` helpers to use them across multiple files. They will not be
callable from outside of your Convex functions.

See
[Type annotating server side helpers](/understanding/best-practices/typescript.mdx#type-annotating-server-side-helpers)
for more guidance on TypeScript types.

## Using NPM packages

Mutations can import NPM packages installed in `node_modules`. Not all NPM
packages are supported, see
[Runtimes](/functions/runtimes.mdx#default-convex-runtime) for more details.

```sh
npm install @faker-js/faker
```

<TSAndJSSnippet sourceTS={NPM} sourceJS={NPM} title="convex/myFunctions.ts" />

## Calling mutations from clients

To call a mutation from [React](/client/react.mdx) use the generated
[`useMutation`](/client/react.mdx#editing-data) hook:

To call a mutation from [React](/client/react.mdx) use the
[`useMutation`](/api/modules/react#usemutation) hook along with the generated
[`api`](/generated-api/api) object.

<TSAndJSSnippet sourceTS={Call} sourceJS={Call} title="src/myApp.tsx" />

See the [React](/client/react.mdx) client documentation for all the ways queries
can be called.

When mutations are called from the [React](/client/react.mdx) or
[Rust](/client/rust.md) clients, they are executed one at a time in a single,
ordered queue. You don't have to worry about mutations editing the database in a
different order than they were triggered.

## Transactions

Mutations run **transactionally**. This means that:

1. All database reads inside the transaction get a consistent view of the data
   in the database. You don't have to worry about a concurrent update changing
   the data in the middle of the execution.
2. All database writes get committed together. If the mutation writes some data
   to the database, but later throws an error, no data is actually written to
   the database.

For this to work, similarly to queries, mutations must be deterministic, and
cannot call third party APIs. To call third party APIs, use
[actions](/functions/actions.mdx).

## Limits

Mutations have a limit to the amount of data they can read and write at once to
guarantee good performance. Check out these limits
[here](/functions/error-handling/error-handling.mdx#database-limitations).

For information on other limits, see [here](/production/state/limits.mdx).
