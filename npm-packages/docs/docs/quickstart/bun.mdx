# Using Convex with Bun

<StepByStep>
  <Step title="Create a new Bun project">
    Create a new directory for your Bun project.

    ```sh
    mkdir my-project && cd my-project && bun init -y
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Convex client and server library">
    Install the `convex` package.

    ```sh
    bun add convex
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up a Convex dev deployment">
    Next, run `bunx convex dev`. This
    will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
    create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.

    It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
    to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
    will then continue running to sync your functions
    with your dev deployment in the cloud.


    ```sh
    bunx convex dev
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create sample data for your database">
    In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl`
    file with some sample data.

    <Snippet
      source={sampleData}
      title="sampleData.jsonl"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the sample data to your database">
    Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table
    with the sample data into your Convex database with
    the `import` command.

    ```
    bunx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Expose a database query">
    Add a new file `tasks.js` in the `convex/` folder
    with a query function that loads the data.

    Exporting a query function from this file
    declares an API function named after the file
    and the export name, `api.tasks.get`.

    <Snippet
      source={tasks}
      title="convex/tasks.js"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect the script to your backend">
    In a new file `index.ts`, create a `ConvexClient` using
    the URL of your development environment.

    <Snippet
      source={script}
      title="index.ts"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the script">
    Run the script from the same directory and see the list of tasks logged to the terminal.

    ```sh
    bun index.ts
    ```

  </Step>

</StepByStep>
