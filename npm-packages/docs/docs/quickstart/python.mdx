Learn how to query data from Convex in a Python app.

<StepByStep>
  <Step title="Create a Python script folder">
    Create a folder for your Python script
    with a virtual environment.

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv my-app/venv
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Convex client and server libraries">
    To get started, install the `convex` npm
    package which enables you to write your
    backend.

    And also install the `convex` Python client
    library and `python-dotenv` for working with `.env` files.

    ```sh
    cd my-app && npm init -y && npm install convex && venv/bin/pip install convex python-dotenv
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up a Convex dev deployment">
    Next, run `npx convex dev`. This
    will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
    create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.

    It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
    to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
    will then continue running to sync your functions
    with your dev deployment in the cloud.


    ```sh
    npx convex dev
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create sample data for your database">
    In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl`
    file with some sample data.

    <Snippet
      source={sampleData}
      title="sampleData.jsonl"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the sample data to your database">
    Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table
    with the sample data into your Convex database with
    the `import` command.

    ```
    npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Expose a database query">
    Add a new file `tasks.js` in the `convex/` folder
    with a query function that loads the data.

    Exporting a query function from this file
    declares an API function named after the file
    and the export name, `"tasks:get"`.

    <Snippet
      source={tasks}
      title="convex/tasks.js"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a script to load data from Convex">
    In a new file `main.py`, create a `ConvexClient` and use it
    to fetch from your `"tasks:get"` API.
    
    <Snippet
      source={main}
      title="main.py"
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the script">
      Run the script 
      and see the serialized list of tasks.

      ```sh
      venv/bin/python -m main
      ```

  </Step>
