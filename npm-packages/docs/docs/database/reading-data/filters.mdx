# Filtering

The [`filter`](/api/interfaces/server.Query#filter) method allows you to
restrict the documents that your document query returns. This method takes a
filter constructed by [`FilterBuilder`](/api/interfaces/server.FilterBuilder)
and will only select documents that match.

The examples below demonstrate some of the common uses of `filter`. You can see
the full list of available filtering methods
[in the reference docs](/api/interfaces/server.FilterBuilder).

If you need to filter to documents containing some keywords, use a
[search query](/search/search.mdx).

<Admonition type="caution" title="Use indexes instead">
  Filters effectively loop over your table looking for documents that match.
  This can be slow or cause your function to hit a
  [limit](/production/state/limits.mdx) when your table has thousands of rows.
  For faster more database efficient queries use [indexes
  instead](/database/reading-data/indexes/indexes.md).
</Admonition>

### Equality conditions

This document query finds documents in the `users` table where
`doc.name === "Alex"`:

```ts
// Get all users named "Alex".
const usersNamedAlex = await ctx.db
  .query("users")
  .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("name"), "Alex"))
  .collect();
```

Here `q` is the [`FilterBuilder`](/api/interfaces/server.FilterBuilder) utility
object. It contains methods for all of our supported filter operators.

This filter will run on all documents in the table. For each document,
`q.field("name")` evaluates to the `name` property. Then `q.eq` checks if this
property is equal to `"Alex"`.

If your query references a field that is missing from a given document then that
field will be considered to have the value `undefined`.

### Comparisons

Filters can also be used to compare fields against values. This document query
finds documents where `doc.age >= 18`:

```ts
// Get all users with an age of 18 or higher.
const adults = await ctx.db
  .query("users")
  .filter((q) => q.gte(q.field("age"), 18))
  .collect();
```

Here the `q.gte` operator checks if the first argument (`doc.age`) is greater
than or equal to the second (`18`).

Here's the full list of comparisons:

| Operator      | Equivalent TypeScript |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| `q.eq(l, r)`  | `l === r`             |
| `q.neq(l, r)` | `l !== r`             |
| `q.lt(l, r)`  | `l < r`               |
| `q.lte(l, r)` | `l <= r`              |
| `q.gt(l, r)`  | `l > r`               |
| `q.gte(l, r)` | `l >= r`              |

### Arithmetic

You can also include basic arithmetic in your queries. This document query finds
documents in the `carpets` table where `doc.height * doc.width > 100`:

```ts
// Get all carpets that have an area of over 100.
const largeCarpets = await ctx.db
  .query("carpets")
  .filter((q) => q.gt(q.mul(q.field("height"), q.field("width")), 100))
  .collect();
```

Here's the full list of arithmetic operators:

| Operator      | Equivalent TypeScript |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| `q.add(l, r)` | `l + r`               |
| `q.sub(l, r)` | `l - r`               |
| `q.mul(l, r)` | `l * r`               |
| `q.div(l, r)` | `l / r`               |
| `q.mod(l, r)` | `l % r`               |
| `q.neg(x)`    | `-x`                  |

### Combining operators

You can construct more complex filters using methods like `q.and`, `q.or`, and
`q.not`. This document query finds documents where
`doc.name === "Alex" && doc.age >= 18`:

```ts
// Get all users named "Alex" whose age is at least 18.
const adultAlexes = await ctx.db
  .query("users")
  .filter((q) =>
    q.and(q.eq(q.field("name"), "Alex"), q.gte(q.field("age"), 18)),
  )
  .collect();
```

Here is a query that finds all users where
`doc.name === "Alex" || doc.name === "Emma"`:

```ts
// Get all users named "Alex" or "Emma".
const usersNamedAlexOrEmma = await ctx.db
  .query("users")
  .filter((q) =>
    q.or(q.eq(q.field("name"), "Alex"), q.eq(q.field("name"), "Emma")),
  )
  .collect();
```

## Advanced filtering techniques

Sometimes the filter syntax is is not expressive enough. For example you may
want to collect all posts that have a tag. Your schema for the posts looks like
this:

```ts
export default defineSchema({
  posts: defineTable({
    body: v.string(),
    tags: v.array(v.string()),
  }),
});
```

One way to solve is by applying the filter on the result of the `collect()`
call. This is just filtering a JavaScript array:

```ts
export const postsWithTag = query({
  args: { tag: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const allPosts = await ctx.db.query("posts").collect();
    return allPosts.filter((post) => post.tags.includes(args.tag));
  },
});
```

But this requires reading the whole table first. If you want to just get the
first result that matches, reading the whole table could be very inefficient.
Instead you may want to use the JavaScript
[`for await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of)
syntax to loop through the table one document at a time:

```ts
export const firstPostWithTag = query({
  args: { tag: v.string() },
  handler: (ctx, args) => {
    for await (const post of db.query("posts")) {
      if (post.tags.includes(args.tag)) {
        return post;
      }
    }
  },
});
```

This works because Convex queries are
[JavaScript iterables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols).

Even with this optimization you are still just looping over the table to find
the first post that matches and may hit your function limits. Using indexes is
still the way to go. You can read a
[detailed discussion of how to handle tags with indexes](https://stack.convex.dev/complex-filters-in-convex#optimize-with-indexes).

## Querying performance and limits

Most of the example document queries above can lead to a _full table scan_. That
is, for the document query to return the requested results, it might need to
walk over every single document in the table.

Take this simple example:

```ts
const tasks = await ctx.db.query("tasks").take(5);
```

This document query will not scan more than 5 documents.

On the other hand, this document query:

```ts
const tasks = await ctx.db
  .query("tasks")
  .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("isCompleted"), true))
  .first();
```

might need to walk over every single document in the `"tasks"` table just to
find the first one with `isCompleted: true`.

If a table has more than a few thousand documents, you should use
[indexes](/database/reading-data/indexes/indexes.md) to improve your document
query performance. Otherwise, you may run into our enforced limits, detailed in
[Read/write limit errors](/functions/error-handling/error-handling.mdx#readwrite-limit-errors).

For information on other limits, see [Limits](/production/state/limits.mdx).
