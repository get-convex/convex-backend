Files can be uploaded to Convex from a client and stored directly, see
[Upload](/docs/file-storage/upload-files.mdx).

Alternatively files can also be stored after they've been fetched or generated
in [actions](/docs/functions/actions.mdx) and
[HTTP actions](/docs/functions/http-actions.mdx). For example you might call a
third-party API to generate an image based on a user prompt and then store that
image in Convex.

**Example:**
[Dall-E Storage & Action](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/dall-e-storage-action)

## Storing files in actions

Storing files in actions is similar to
[uploading a file via an HTTP action](/docs/file-storage/upload-files.mdx#uploading-files-via-an-http-action).

The action takes these steps:

1. Fetch or generate an image.
2. Store the image using
   [`storage.store()`](/api/interfaces/server.StorageActionWriter#store) and
   receive a storage ID.
3. Save the storage ID into your data model via a mutation.

Storage IDs correspond to documents in the `"_storage"` system table (see
[Metadata](/docs/file-storage/file-metadata.mdx)), so they can be validated
using the `v.id("_storage")` validator and typed as `Id<"_storage">` in
TypeScript.
