The `convex-test` library provides a mock implementation of the Convex backend
in JavaScript. It enables fast automated testing of the logic in your
[functions](/docs/functions.mdx).

**Example:** The library includes a
[test suite](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-test/tree/main/convex) which
you can browse to see examples of using it.

## Get Started

<StepByStep>

  <Step title="Install test dependencies">
    Install [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and the [`convex-test`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convex-test) library.

    ```sh
    npm install --save-dev convex-test vitest @edge-runtime/vm
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup NPM scripts">
    
    Add these scripts to your `package.json`

    ```json title="package.json"
    "scripts": {
      "test": "vitest",
      "test:once": "vitest run",
      "test:debug": "vitest --inspect-brk --no-file-parallelism",
      "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage --coverage.reporter=text",
    }
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Vitest">
    
    Add <JSDialectFileName name="vitest.config.mts" /> file to configure the test
    environment to better match the Convex runtime, and to inline the test library
    for better dependency tracking.

    ```ts title="vitest.config.mts"
    import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

    export default defineConfig({
      test: {
        environment: "edge-runtime",
        server: { deps: { inline: ["convex-test"] } },
      },
    });
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a test file">
    
    In your `convex` folder add a file ending in <JSDialectFileName name=".test.ts" />

    The example test calls the `api.messages.send` mutation twice
    and then asserts that the `api.messages.list` query returns
    the expected results.

    ```ts title="convex/messages.test.ts"
    import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
    import { expect, test } from "vitest";
    import { api } from "./_generated/api";
    import schema from "./schema";

    test("sending messages", async () => {
      const t = convexTest(schema);
      await t.mutation(api.messages.send, { body: "Hi!", author: "Sarah" });
      await t.mutation(api.messages.send, { body: "Hey!", author: "Tom" });
      const messages = await t.query(api.messages.list);
      expect(messages).toMatchObject([
        { body: "Hi!", author: "Sarah" },
        { body: "Hey!", author: "Tom" }
      ]);
    });
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run tests">

    Start the tests with `npm run test`. When you change the test file or your
    functions the tests will rerun automatically.

    ```sh
    npm run test
    ```

  </Step>

</StepByStep>

If you're not familiar with Vitest or Jest read the
[Vitest Getting Started docs](https://vitest.dev/guide) first.

## `convexTest`

The library exports a `convexTest` function which should be called at the start
of each of your tests. The function returns an object which is by convention
stored in the `t` variable and which provides methods for exercising your Convex
functions.

If your project uses a [schema](/docs/database/schemas.mdx) you should pass it
to the `convexTest` function:

```ts title="convex/myFunctions.test.ts"
import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
import { test } from "vitest";
import schema from "./schema";

test("some behavior", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema);
  // use `t`...
});
```

Passing in the schema is required for the tests to correctly implement schema
validation and for correct typing of
[`t.run`](#setting-up-and-inspecting-data-and-storage-with-trun).

If you don't have a schema, call `convexTest()` with no argument.

## Calling functions with `t.query`, `t.mutation` and `t.action`

Your test can call public and internal Convex [functions](/docs/functions.mdx)
in your project:

```ts title="convex/myFunctions.test.ts"
import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
import { test } from "vitest";
import { api, internal } from "./_generated/api";

test("functions", async () => {
  const t = convexTest();
  const x = await t.query(api.myFunctions.myQuery, { a: 1, b: 2 });
  const y = await t.query(internal.myFunctions.internalQuery, { a: 1, b: 2 });
  const z = await t.mutation(api.myFunctions.mutateSomething, { a: 1, b: 2 });
  const w = await t.mutation(internal.myFunctions.mutateSomething, { a: 1 });
  const u = await t.action(api.myFunctions.doSomething, { a: 1, b: 2 });
  const v = await t.action(internal.myFunctions.internalAction, { a: 1, b: 2 });
});
```

## Setting up and inspecting data and storage with `t.run`

Sometimes you might want to directly [write](/docs/database/writing-data.mdx) to
the mock database or [file storage](/docs/file-storage.mdx) from your test,
without needing a declared function in your project. You can use the `t.run`
method which takes a handler that is given a `ctx` that allows reading from and
writing to the mock backend:

```ts title="convex/tasks.test.ts"
import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
import { expect, test } from "vitest";

test("functions", async () => {
  const t = convexTest();
  const firstTask = await t.run(async (ctx) => {
    await ctx.db.insert("tasks", { text: "Eat breakfast" });
    return await ctx.db.query("tasks").first();
  });
  expect(firstTask).toMatchObject({ text: "Eat breakfast" });
});
```

## Testing HTTP actions with `t.fetch`

Your test can call [HTTP actions](/docs/functions/http-actions.mdx) registered
by your router:

```ts title="convex/http.test.ts"
import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
import { test } from "vitest";

test("functions", async () => {
  const t = convexTest();
  const response = await t.fetch("/some/path", { method: "POST" });
});
```

Mocking the global `fetch` function doesn't affect `t.fetch`, but you can use
`t.fetch` in a `fetch` mock to route to your HTTP actions.

## Testing scheduled functions

One advantage of using a mock implementation running purely in JavaScript is
that you can control time in the Vitest test environment. To test
implementations relying on
[scheduled functions](/docs/scheduling/scheduled-functions.mdx) use
[Vitest's fake timers](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html#timers) in
combination with `t.finishInProgressScheduledFunctions`:

```ts title="convex/scheduling.test.ts"
import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
import { expect, test, vi } from "vitest";
import { api } from "./_generated/api";
import schema from "./schema";

test("mutation scheduling action", async () => {
  // Enable fake timers
  vi.useFakeTimers();

  const t = convexTest(schema);

  // Call a function that schedules a mutation or action
  const scheduledFunctionId = await t.mutation(
    api.scheduler.mutationSchedulingAction,
    { delayMs: 10000 },
  );

  // Advance the mocked time
  vi.advanceTimersByTime(5000);

  // Advance the mocked time past the scheduled time of the function
  vi.advanceTimersByTime(6000);

  // Or run all currently pending timers
  vi.runAllTimers();

  // At this point the scheduled function will be `inProgress`,
  // now wait for it to finish
  await t.finishInProgressScheduledFunctions();

  // Assert that the scheduled function succeeded or failed
  const scheduledFunctionStatus = t.run(async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.db.get(scheduledFunctionId);
  });
  expect(scheduledFunctionStatus).toMatchObject({ state: { kind: "success" } });

  // Reset to normal `setTimeout` etc. implementation
  vi.useRealTimers();
});
```

If you have a chain of several scheduled functions, for example a mutation that
schedules an action that schedules another action, you can use
`t.finishAllScheduledFunctions` to wait for all scheduled functions, including
recursively scheduled functions, to finish:

```ts title="convex/chainedScheduling.test.ts"
import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
import { expect, test, vi } from "vitest";
import { api } from "./_generated/api";
import schema from "./schema";

test("mutation scheduling action scheduling action", async () => {
  // Enable fake timers
  vi.useFakeTimers();

  const t = convexTest(schema);

  // Call a function that schedules a mutation or action
  await t.mutation(api.scheduler.mutationSchedulingActionSchedulingAction);

  // Wait for all scheduled functions, repeatedly
  // advancing time and waiting for currently in-progress
  // functions to finish
  await t.finishAllScheduledFunctions(vi.runAllTimers);

  // Assert the resulting state after all scheduled functions finished
  const createdTask = t.run(async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.db.query("tasks").first();
  });
  expect(createdTask).toMatchObject({ author: "AI" });

  // Reset to normal `setTimeout` etc. implementation
  vi.useRealTimers();
});
```

Check out more examples in
[this file](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-test/blob/main/convex/scheduler.test.ts).

## Testing authentication with `t.withIdentity`

To test functions which depend on the current [authenticated](/docs/auth.mdx)
user identity you can create a version of the `t` accessor with given
[user identity attributes](/api/interfaces/server.UserIdentity). If you don't
provide them, `issuer`, `subject` and `tokenIdentifier` will be generated
automatically:

```ts title="convex/tasks.test.ts"
import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
import { expect, test } from "vitest";
import { api } from "./_generated/api";
import schema from "./schema";

test("authenticated functions", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema);

  const asSarah = t.withIdentity({ name: "Sarah" });
  await asSarah.mutation(api.tasks.create, { text: "Add tests" });

  const sarahsTasks = await asSarah.query(api.tasks.list);
  expect(sarahsTasks).toMatchObject([{ text: "Add tests" }]);

  const asLee = t.withIdentity({ name: "Lee" });
  const leesTasks = await asLee.query(api.tasks.list);
  expect(leesTasks).toEqual([]);
});
```

## Mocking `fetch` calls

You can use Vitest's
[vi.stubGlobal](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html#globals) method:

```ts title="convex/ai.test.ts"
import { expect, test, vi } from "vitest";
import { convexTest } from "../index";
import { api } from "./_generated/api";
import schema from "./schema";

test("ai", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema);

  vi.stubGlobal(
    "fetch",
    vi.fn(async () => ({ text: async () => "I am the overlord" }) as Response),
  );

  const reply = await t.action(api.messages.sendAIMessage, { prompt: "hello" });
  expect(reply).toEqual("I am the overlord");

  vi.unstubAllGlobals();
});
```

## Asserting results

See Vitest's [Expect](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html) reference.

[`toMatchObject()`](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html#tomatchobject) is
particularly helpful when asserting the shape of results without needing to list
every object field.

### Asserting errors

To assert that a function throws, use
[`.rejects.toThrowError()`](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html#tothrowerror):

```ts title="convex/messages.test.ts"
import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
import { expect, test } from "vitest";
import { api } from "./_generated/api";
import schema from "./schema";

test("messages validation", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema);
  expect(async () => {
    await t.mutation(api.messages.send, { body: "", author: "James" });
  }).rejects.toThrowError("Empty message body is not allowed");
});
```

## Measuring test coverage

You can get a printout of the code coverage provided by your tests. Besides
answering the question "how much of my code is covered by tests" it is also
helpful to check that your test is actually exercising the code that you want it
to exercise.

Run <CodeWithCopyButton text="npm run test:coverage" />. It will ask you to
install a required dependency the first time you run it.

<p style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src="/screenshots/testing_coverage.png"
    alt="example coverage printout"
    width={700}
  />
</p>

## Debugging tests

You can attach a debugger to the running tests. Read the Vitest
[Debugging docs](https://vitest.dev/guide/debugging.html) and then
use&#32;<CodeWithCopyButton text="npm run test:debug" />.

## Multiple environments

If you want to use Vitest to test both your Convex functions and your React
frontend, you might want to use multiple Vitest environments depending on the
test file location via
[environmentMatchGlobs](https://vitest.dev/config/#environmentmatchglobs):

```ts title="vitest.config.mts"
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environmentMatchGlobs: [
      // all tests in convex/ will run in edge-runtime
      ["convex/**", "edge-runtime"],
      // all other tests use jsdom
      ["**", "jsdom"],
    ],
    server: { deps: { inline: ["convex-test"] } },
  },
});
```

## Custom `convex/` folder name or location

If your project has a
[different name or location configured](/docs/production/project-configuration.mdx#changing-the-convex-folder-name-or-location)
for the `convex/` folder in `convex.json`, you need to call
[`import.meta.glob`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features#glob-import) and pass the
result as the second argument to `convexTest`.

The argument to `import.meta.glob` must be a glob pattern matching all the files
containing your Convex functions. The paths are relative to the test file in
which `import.meta.glob` is called. It's best to do this in one place in your
custom functions folder:

```ts title="src/convex/test.setup.ts"
/// <reference types="vite/client" />
export const modules = import.meta.glob("./**/!(*.*.*)*.*s");
```

This example glob pattern includes all files with a single extension ending in
`s` (like `js` or `ts`) in the `src/convex` folder and any of its children.

Use the result in your tests:

```ts title="src/convex/messages.test.ts"
import { convexTest } from "convex-test";
import { test } from "vitest";
import schema from "./schema";
import { modules } from "./test.setup";

test("some behavior", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema, modules);
  // use `t`...
});
```

## Limitations

Since `convex-test` is only a mock implementation, it doesn't have many of the
behaviors of the real Convex backend. Still, it should be helpful for testing
the logic in your functions, and catching regressions caused by changes to your
code.

Some of the ways the mock differs:

- Error messages content. You should not write product logic that relies on the
  content of error messages thrown by the real backend, as they are always
  subject to change.
- Limits. The mock doesn't enforce size and time
  [limits](/docs/production/state/limits.mdx).
- ID format. Your code should not depend on the document or storage ID format.
- Runtime built-ins. Most of your functions are written for the
  [Convex default runtime](/docs/functions/runtimes.mdx), while Vitest uses a
  mock of Vercel's Edge Runtime, which is similar but might differ from the
  Convex runtime. You should always test new code manually to make sure it
  doesn't use built-ins not available in the Convex runtime.
- Some features have only simplified semantics, namely:
  - [Text search](/docs/search.mdx) returns all documents that include a word
    for which at least one word in the searched string is a prefix. It does not
    implement fuzzy searching and doesn't sort the results by relevance.
  - [Vector search](/docs/search/vector-search.mdx) returns results sorted by
    cosine similarity, but doesn't use an efficient vector index in its
    implementation.
  - There is no support for [cron jobs](/docs/scheduling/cron-jobs.mdx), you
    should trigger your functions manually from the test.

To test your functions running on a real Convex backend, check out
[Testing Local Backend](/docs/testing/convex-backend.mdx).

## CI

See [Continuous Integration](/docs/testing/ci.mdx) to run your tests on a shared
remote machine.
