Alternatively to [`convex-test`](/docs/testing/convex-test.mdx) you can test
your functions using the
[open-source version of the Convex backend](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend).

## Getting Started

Follow [this guide](https://stack.convex.dev/testing-with-local-oss-backend) for
the instructions.

Compared to `convex-test`, which uses a JS mock of the backend, running your
tests against the real backend has these advantages:

- Your tests will run against the same code as your Convex production (as long
  you keep the local backend up-to-date).
- Limits on argument, data, query sizes are enforced.
- You can bootstrap a large test dataset from a data import.
- You can test your client code in combination with your backend logic.

## Limitations

Note that testing against the local backend also has some drawbacks:

- It requires setting up the local backend, which is more involved.
- No control over time and any scheduled functions will run as scheduled.
- Crons will also run unless disabled via
  [`IS_TEST`](https://stack.convex.dev/testing-with-local-oss-backend#setting-up-a-local-backend).
- No way to mock `fetch` calls.
- No way to mock dependencies or parts of the codebase.
- No way to control randomness (tests may not be deterministic).
- No way to set environment variable values from within tests.

To test your functions in JS with a mocked Convex backend, check out
[convex-test](/docs/testing/convex-test.mdx).

## CI

See [Continuous Integration](/docs/testing/ci.mdx) to run your tests on a shared
remote machine.
