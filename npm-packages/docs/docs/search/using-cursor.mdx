[Cursor](https://cursor.com), the AI code editor, makes it easy to write and
maintain apps built with Convex. Let's walk through how to setup Cursor for the
best possible results with Convex.

# Add Convex to Cursor’s Docs

[Cursor composer agent](https://docs.cursor.com/composer/overview#agent), the
main AI coding agent built into Cursor, uses Claude as it's LLM model of choice.
While Claude knows about Convex, its knowledge can be patchy or outdated.

We need to give it a helping hand by using the
[Cursors Docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs) feature to give
it the most up-to-date knowledge of Convex.

From **`Cursor Settings`** > **`Features`** > **`Docs`** add new doc, use the
URL "https://docs.convex.dev/"

Cursor will then index all of the Convex docs for the LLM to use.

You can then reference those docs in your prompt with the `@Convex` symbol.

You can perform the above steps for https://stack.convex.dev/ too if you would
like to provide even more context to the agent.

# Install and run Convex yourself

Keeping Convex running is crucial because
[it automatically generates](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#run-the-convex-dev-server)
the client-side types. Without this, the agent can get stuck in a linting loop
since it can't access the types for the queries and mutations it created.

We recommended that you install (`npm install convex`) and run convex
(`npx convex dev`) yourself in a terminal window.

# Use a `convex_instructions.md` to fine-tune Convex behavior even further

Despite Claude’s inbuilt knowledge of Convex plus referencing `@Convex` docs the
LLM does still make silly Convex mistakes from time to time. To reduce this even
more create a `convex_instructions.md` file in `/instructions` directory. Then
reference it from your prompt.

To get you started see this one we have been using:

[convex_instructions.md](https://gist.github.com/mikecann/0dc25aeae0d06a88c3da71c1e026ae47)

Copy the above to your project then reference it in your prompts. You can edit
it as needed.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Cursor Notepads">

Cursor does have a beta feature called
[Notepads](https://docs.cursor.com/features/beta/notepads#notepads) that may be
a better way to do this in the future.

# Keep your requests small and git commit frequently

The best results when using agentic LLMs can be found when keeping the amount of
changes you want to make small. This lets you be more specific around the
context you provide the agent and it means the agent doesn't need to do a lot of
searching for context.

After each successful prompt or series of prompts it is a good idea to commit
your changes so that its simple to rollback to that point should the next prompt
cause issues.

# Update and reference your `README.md`

The agent needs context about the specific business goals for your project.
While it can infer some details from the files it reads, this becomes more
challenging as your project grows. Providing general information about your
project gives the agent a helpful head start.

Rather than including this information in each prompt, it's better to write a
comprehensive README.md file in your project root and reference it.

[Some people](https://youtu.be/2PjmPU07KNs?t=145) advocate for crafting a
Product Requirements Document (PRD), this may be a good idea for more complex
projects.
