# OAuth Applications

Convex allows third-party app developers to manage a user's projects on their
behalf through **Application Tokens**.

Application tokens are obtained through the OAuth authorization code flow, which
will be described in detail below.

There are two types of OAuth tokens:

- Team-scoped tokens that are authorized to create new projects, create new
  deployments within projects, and have read and write access to data and
  functions to every project on the team.
- Project-scoped tokens that can create new deployments and access data and
  functions within a specific project.

<Admonition type="note">
  All application tokens are also scoped to the permissions of the member that
  authorized usage. If the member is removed from the team, or their permissions
  changed, the permissions of the token will also change.
</Admonition>

## Creating an application

To obtain application tokens, you'll first have to register an OAuth application
with Convex, which can be done in your
[Team Settings](https://dashboard.convex.dev/team/settings/applications/oauth-apps).

To register an application, you'll need to provide a name for the application
and a set of redirect URIs. Redirect URIs are used to return users to your
application once they have authorized you to access their Convex team or
project. You may add up to 20 redirect URIs, including ones pointing to
[localhost](http://localhost) for testing.

Once you've created your application, it will be in the "Unverified" state. In
the Unverified state, you'll be able to obtain application tokens for your own
team, but not for other teams. We recommend testing your application in the
Unverified state before requesting verification.

You may request verification by clicking the ⋮ button next to your application,
and clicking "Request Verification".

### Verification requirements

To have your application be verified and be accessible for all Convex users, it
must meet the following criteria:

- The application description has an explanation of the capabilities and planned
  future capabilities of your application.
- The application name, redirect URIs, and content of the redirect URIs do not
  attempt to misrepresent another organization, business, or entity.
- The listed redirect URIs belong to your organization.

The Convex team will respond to your verification request by email if more
information is required.

## Implementing OAuth

Convex implements [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) (RFC 6749)'s
[Authorization Code Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/)
flow. Convex also optionally supports the
[PKCE extension](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/) (RFC 7636) to improve security.

- Convex provides two _authorization endpoint_ URLs, depending on whether you
  are generating team-scoped or project-scoped tokens:
  - `https://dashboard.convex.dev/oauth/authorize/team`
  - `https://dashboard.convex.dev/oauth/authorize/project`
- Convex's **token endpoint** is `https://api.convex.dev/oauth/token`.

We'll walk through the authorization flow step by step. However, we recommend
using an OAuth 2.0 client library to help construct the required URLs and API
calls.

## Step 1: Redirect the user to Convex's authorization endpoint

In your application, navigate the user to:

`https://dashboard.convex.dev/oauth/authorize[TOKEN_SCOPE]?client_id=[CLIENT_ID]&redirect_uri=[REDIRECT_URI]&response_type=code&state=[STATE]`

- `[TOKEN_SCOPE]` should be replaced with "team" or "project"
- `[CLIENT_ID]` should be replaced with your app's client ID as assigned by
  Convex.
- `[REDIRECT_URI]` is a URL on your application's domain. The user will be
  redirected back to that URL after authorizing.
  - **Important note**: You'll need to provide us with all the redirect URIs
    that your application might use (likely just one). This is required to
    prevent a malicious application from masquerading as yours, but redirecting
    to a different callback.
- `[STATE]` is an optional arbitrary string. It's up to you how to encode it,
  but your application will use this to decide what to do with the auth token
  after it receives it.

**Remember to URI-encode all the parameters!**

This brings the user to a page that looks like this:

![OAuth authorization page](/screenshots/oauth-page.png)

From here, the user can select which team they'd like to authorize access to. If
using the project flow, the user will also be able to select an existing project
or create a new project. After they click "Authorize", the page will redirect to
your redirect URL.

## Step 2: Receive the callback

The authorization endpoint brings the user to your redirect URI with the `code`
and `state` query parameters populated. If your `redirect_uri` was
`https://yourapp.example.com/cb`, the result would look like:

`https://yourapp.example.com/cb?code=[CODE]&state=[STATE]`

where `state` is the same value you provided earlier, and `code` is a randomly
generated string like `895c59eb98504a5bbaa7ad2e49cf4817`. This code **is not**
the final auth token - you'll need to exchange it for one within 10 minutes.

## Step 3: Exchange the authorization code for a project token

Your application should make an HTTP POST request to the following endpoint:

`https://api.convex.dev/oauth/token`

The body should have content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and look
like the following:

`client_id=[CLIENT_ID]&client_secret=[CLIENT_SECRET]&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=[REDIRECT_URI]&code=[CODE]`

- `client_id` is the same one used to construct the authorization endpoint URL.
- `client_secret` is your app's secret assigned by Convex.
- `grant_type` is always `authorization_code`.
- `redirect_uri` is the same one used to construct the authorization endpoint
  URL.
- `code` is the authorization code provided to your callback.
  - Note that a `code` can only be exchanged _once_ for an access token.

If all provided values are correct, Convex's API returns a JSON response
containing:

```jsx
{
	"access_token": "team:my-team|AAAAAA==",
	"token_type": "bearer"
}
```

The `access_token` is the application token!

# Using PKCE (RFC 7636)

Convex supports this extension to the Authorization Code grant type. Only the
`S256` method is allowed. PKCE protects a leaked authorization code from being
used by an attacker even if your client secret is not private (e.g. if it has to
be embedded in a client-side application).

OAuth client libraries typically support PKCE already, but to implement it
manually:

- Each time you request user authorization, before redirecting the user,
  construct a random string called the `code_verifier`. It's recommended that
  you generate a random 32-byte value and base64url-encode it.
- Calculate `code_challenge = base64url(sha256(code_verifier))`. This will be a
  43-character string.
- Redirect the user to authorization endpoint as before
  (`/oauth/authorize/[TOKEN_SCOPE]`), but additionally provide the parameters
  `code_challenge=[CODE_CHALLENGE]&code_challenge_method=S256`.
- When exchanging the authorization code for a token, additionally provide the
  parameter `code_verifier=[CODE_VERIFIER]`.
