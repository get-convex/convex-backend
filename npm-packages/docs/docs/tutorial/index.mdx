# Convex Tutorial: A chat app

Convex provides you with a fully featured backend with cloud functions,
database, scheduling, and a sync engine that keeps your frontend and backend up
to date in real-time.

Today, in about **10 lines of code,** we'll build a backend that reads and
writes to the database and automatically updates all users in a chat app.

After that we'll see how to connect to external services and setup your product
for success and scale.

## Start developing with Convex

<Details summary="Before you begin: You'll need Node.js 18+ and Git">

Ensure you have Node.js version 18 or greater installed on your computer. You
can check your version of Node.js by running `node --version` in your terminal.
If you don't have the appropriate version of Node.js installed,
[install it from the Node.js website.](https://nodejs.org/en)

In addition, this walkthrough requires Git, so verify you have it installed by
running `git -v` in your terminal. If not, head over to the
[Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for
installation instructions.

</Details>

First, clone the example project repo from GitHub and install the dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/get-convex/convex-tutorial.git
cd convex-tutorial
npm install
```

This app's `dev` npm command sets up Convex and then runs the web app:

```shell
npm run dev
```

During setup, you'll see that Convex uses your GitHub account for
authentication. Sign into Convex with GitHub and then accept the default project
setup prompts.

This will **automatically create your backend** and a folder called `convex/` in
your project, where you'll write your backend code.

**Make sure you keep this command (`npm run dev`) running in the background
throughout this tutorial.** It's running both the dev web server for the
frontend as well as the `convex` command in the background to keep your backend
in sync with your local codebase.

Once your server is up and running, open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
and check it out:

</div>

If you try sending a message now, you'll see an alert telling you the mutation
is not yet implemented. We'll do that in a bit, but first here's a quick summary
of how Convex works.

## How Convex works

<div className="center-image" style={{ maxWidth: "700px" }}>
  ![Overview of the sync engine](/img/tutorial/ConvexSyncEngine.png)
</div>

**Database.** The Convex database is a document-relational database, which means
you have tables with JSON like documents in them. All documents have an
auto-generated `_id` that can be used to create relations between documents. You
interact with the database through mutation and query functions that are written
entirely in TypeScript.

**Mutation functions.** Mutations are TypeScript functions that update the
database. All mutation functions in Convex run as a database transaction. So
either all the changes are committed, or none are.

**Query functions.** Queries are TypeScript functions that can only read from
the database. As we'll see in a bit, you subscribe to them from your frontend to
keep your app automatically up to date.

Your frontend registers to listen to query updates through the **client
library**. The client libraries talk to Convex via WebSockets for fast realtime
updates.

The **sync engine** reruns query functions when any input to the function
changes, including any changes to the documents in the database that the query
reads. It then updates every app listening to the query. The sync engine is the
combination of queries, mutations and the database.

Now, let's dive into the code!

## Your first `mutation`

Create a new file in your `convex/` folder called `chat.ts`. This is where
you'll write your Convex backend functions for this application.

**Add the following to your `convex/chat.ts` file.**

```typescript
import { mutation } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const sendMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    user: v.string(),
    body: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    console.log("This TypeScript function is running on the server.");
    await ctx.db.insert("messages", {
      user: args.user,
      body: args.body,
    });
  },
});
```

Let's break this down:

1. You've added a new backend `mutation` function called `sendMessage` and
   exposed it as a public api.
1. The whole function automatically runs as a transaction that will roll back if
   an exception is thrown.
1. Since this is just a TypeScript function you can drop `console.log` lines to
   do simple debugging on the server.
1. `args:` ensures the function arguments are two strings named `user` and
   `body`, both as types and runtime values.
1. `ctx.db.insert` tells Convex to insert a new message document into the table.

Now, let's connect this mutation to your web app.

**Update your `src/App.tsx` file like so:**

```tsx
// highlight-next-line
// Import `useMutation` and `api` from Convex.
// highlight-next-line
import { useMutation } from "convex/react";
// highlight-next-line
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

//...

export default function App() {
  // highlight-next-line
  // Replace the "TODO: Add mutation hook here." with:
  // highlight-next-line
  const sendMessage = useMutation(api.chat.sendMessage);

  //...

  return (
    <main className="chat">
      {/* ... */}
      <form
        onSubmit={async (e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          // highlight-next-line
          // Replace "alert("Mutation not implemented yet");" with:
          // highlight-next-line
          await sendMessage({ user: NAME, body: newMessageText });

          setNewMessageText("");
        }}
      >
        {/* ... */}
      </form>
    </main>
  );
}
```

There are two steps to call a mutation in your frontend:

1. `const sendMessage = useMutation(api.chat.sendMessage);` gives your frontend
   app a handle to the mutation function
2. `await sendMessage({ user: NAME, body: newMessageText });` calls the mutation
   with the proper parameters.

This is a good time to **open up the Convex dashboard**. Open a new browser
window and go to [https://dashboard.convex.dev](https://dashboard.convex.dev)
and find new `convex-tutorial` project.

**Go to the "Data" screen**. So far, there is no data in your database.

**Keep your chat app and dashboard windows open side by side**. Now try to send
some messages from your chat app.

  <source src="/img/tutorial/tut_first_mutation.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

You'll notice new chat messages showing up live in the `messages` table.

Convex automatically created a `messages` table when you sent the first message.
In Convex, [schemas](/database/schemas.mdx) are optional. Eventually, you'll
want to enforce the structure of your tables, but for the purposes of the
tutorial we'll skip this.

In the dashboard you can also go to the
[logs screen](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/logs) and see every call
to the mutation as you ran with the log line we added earlier. The logs screen
is a critical part of debugging your backend in development.

You've successfully created a `mutation` function, which is also a database
transaction, and connected it to your UI.

Now, let's make sure your app can update live the same way the dashboard is
updating live.

## Your first `query`

**Update your `convex/chat.ts` file like this:**

```tsx
// highlight-next-line
// Update your server import like this:
// highlight-next-line
import { query, mutation } from "./_generated/server";

// ...

// highlight-next-line
// Add the following function to the file:
// highlight-next-line
export const getMessages = query({
  // highlight-next-line
  args: {},
  // highlight-next-line
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    // highlight-next-line
    // Get most recent messages first
    // highlight-next-line
    const messages = await ctx.db.query("messages").order("desc").take(50);
    // highlight-next-line
    // Reverse the list so that it's in a chronological order.
    // highlight-next-line
    return messages.reverse();
    // highlight-next-line
  },
  // highlight-next-line
});
```

Let's break this down:

1. You've added a new backend `query` function called `getMessages` and exposed
   it as a public api.
1. Since this is a query function, the `ctx.db` in this function only lets you
   read data.
1. In the first line of the `handler` you are querying the most recent 50
   messages from newest to oldest.
1. In the second line you're reversing the list using plain old TypeScript.

**Now update `src/App.tsx` to read from your query:**

```tsx
// highlight-next-line
// Update your convex/react import like this:
// highlight-next-line
import { useQuery, useMutation } from "convex/react";

//...

export default function App() {
  // highlight-next-line
  // Replace the `const messages = ...` line with the following
  // highlight-next-line
  const messages = useQuery(api.chat.getMessages);

  //...
}
```

That one `useQuery` line is doing a lot of work automatically for you. It's
telling the Convex client library to subscribe to your `getMessages` function.
Anytime there are new messages to show the query function is automatically
rerun. The result is put in `const messages` variable and React rerenders your
UI component to show the latest messages.

That's it. Now go back to your app and try sending messages.

Your app should be showing live updates as new messages arrive:

  <source src="/img/tutorial/tut_first_query.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Queries hooked up and live updating to the app.
</video>

<br />
<br />
Don't believe it? Try opening two chat windows side by side and send some
messages:

<video autoPlay playsInline muted loop width="100%">
  <source src="/img/tutorial/tut_side_by_side.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Live syncing chat app.
</video>

## What you built

With just a few lines of code you've built a live updating chat app.

1. You created a `mutation` TypeScript function that, in a transaction, adds new
   chat messages to your database.
1. You created a `query` TypeScript function updates your app with the latest
   data.
1. You used the client library that keeps your frontend in live sync with the
   backend.

You've learned the fundamentals of Convex and the sync engine that powers
everything.
