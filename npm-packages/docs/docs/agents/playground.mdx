The Playground UI is a simple way to test, debug, and develop with the agent.

![Playground UI Screenshot](https://get-convex.github.io/agent/screenshot.png)

- Pick a user to list their threads.
- Browse the user's threads.
- List the selected thread's messages, along with tool call details.
- Show message metadata details.
- Experiment with contextual message lookup, adjusting context options.
- Send a message to the thread, with configurable saving options.
- It uses api keys to communicate securely with the backend.

There is also a [hosted version here](https://get-convex.github.io/agent/).

## Setup

**Note**: You must already have a Convex project set up with the Agent. See the
[docs](./getting-started.mdx) for setup instructions.

```sh
npm i @convex-dev/agent-playground
```

In your agent Convex project, make a file `convex/playground.ts` with:

```ts
import { definePlaygroundAPI } from "@convex-dev/agent-playground";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
import { weatherAgent, fashionAgent } from "./example";

/**
 * Here we expose the API so the frontend can access it.
 * Authorization is handled by passing up an apiKey that can be generated
 * on the dashboard or via CLI via:
 * npx convex run --component agent apiKeys:issue
 */
export const {
  isApiKeyValid,
  listAgents,
  listUsers,
  listThreads,
  listMessages,
  createThread,
  generateText,
  fetchPromptContext,
} = definePlaygroundAPI(components.agent, {
  agents: [weatherAgent, fashionAgent],
});
```

From in your project's repo, issue yourself an API key:

```sh
npx convex run --component agent apiKeys:issue '{name:"..."}'
```

Note: to generate multiple keys, give a different name to each key. To revoke
and reissue a key, pass the same name.

Then visit the [hosted version](https://get-convex.github.io/agent/).

It will ask for your Convex deployment URL, which can be found in `.env.local`.
It will also ask for your API key that you generated above. If you used a
different path for `convex/playground.ts` you can enter it. E.g. if you had
`convex/foo/bar.ts` where you exported the playground API, you'd put in
`foo/bar`.

## Running it locally

You can run the playground locally with:

```sh
npx @convex-dev/agent-playground
```

It uses the `VITE_CONVEX_URL` env variable, usually pulling it from .env.local.
