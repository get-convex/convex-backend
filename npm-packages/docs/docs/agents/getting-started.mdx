To install the agent component, you'll need an existing Convex project. New to
Convex? Go through the [tutorial](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/).

Run `npm create convex` or follow any of the
[quickstarts](https://docs.convex.dev/home) to set one up.

## Installation

Install the component package:

```ts
npm install @convex-dev/agent
```

Create a `convex.config.ts` file in your app's `convex/` folder and install the
component by calling `use`:

```ts
// convex/convex.config.ts
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";
import agent from "@convex-dev/agent/convex.config";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(agent);

export default app;
```

Then run `npx convex dev` to generate code for the component. This needs to
successfully run once before you start defining Agents.

## Defining your first Agent

```ts
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
import { Agent } from "@convex-dev/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const agent = new Agent(components.agent, {
  name: "My Agent",
  languageModel: openai.chat("gpt-4o-mini"),
  instructions: "You are a weather forecaster.",
  tools: { getWeather, getGeocoding },
  maxSteps: 3,
});
```

## Basic usage

```ts
import { action } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const helloWorld = action({
  args: { city: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, { city }) => {
    const threadId = await createThread(ctx, components.agent);
    const prompt = `What is the weather in ${city}?`;
    const result = await agent.generateText(ctx, { threadId }, { prompt });
    return result.text;
  },
});
```

If you get type errors about `components.agent`, ensure you've run
`npx convex dev` to generate code for the component.

That's it! Check out [Agents](./agents.mdx) to see more details and options.
