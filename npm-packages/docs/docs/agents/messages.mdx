The Agent component stores message and [thread](./threads.mdx) history to enable
conversations between humans and agents.

To see how humans can act as agents, see [Human Agents](./human-agents.mdx).

## Retrieving messages

For clients to show messages, you need to expose a query that returns the
messages. For streaming, see
[retrieving streamed deltas](./streaming.mdx#retrieving-streamed-deltas) for a
modified version of this query.

See
[chat/basic.ts](https://github.com/get-convex/agent/blob/main/example/convex/chat/basic.ts)
for the server-side code, and
[chat/streaming.ts](https://github.com/get-convex/agent/blob/main/example/convex/chat/streaming.ts)
for the streaming example.

```ts
import { paginationOptsValidator } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";
import { listUIMessages } from "@convex-dev/agent";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";

export const listThreadMessages = query({
  args: { threadId: v.string(), paginationOpts: paginationOptsValidator },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    await authorizeThreadAccess(ctx, threadId);

    const paginated = await listUIMessages(ctx, components.agent, args);

    // Here you could filter out / modify the documents
    return paginated;
  },
});
```

Note: Above we used `listUIMessages`, which returns UIMessages, specifically the
Agent extension that includes some extra fields like order, status, etc.
UIMessages combine multiple MessageDocs into a single UIMessage when there are
multiple tool calls followed by an assistant message, making it easy to build
UIs that work with the various "parts" on the UIMessage.

If you want to get MessageDocs, you can use `listMessages` instead.

## Showing messages in React

See
[ChatStreaming.tsx](https://github.com/get-convex/agent/blob/main/example/ui/chat/ChatStreaming.tsx)
for a streaming example, or
[ChatBasic.tsx](https://github.com/get-convex/agent/blob/main/example/ui/chat/ChatBasic.tsx)
for a non-streaming example.

### `useUIMessages` hook

The crux is to use the `useUIMessages` hook. For streaming, pass in
`stream: true` to the hook.

```tsx
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";
import { useUIMessages } from "@convex-dev/agent/react";

function MyComponent({ threadId }: { threadId: string }) {
  const { results, status, loadMore } = useUIMessages(
    api.chat.streaming.listMessages,
    { threadId },
    { initialNumItems: 10 /* stream: true */ },
  );
  return (
    <div>
      {results.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.key}>{message.text}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note: If you want to work with MessageDocs instead of UIMessages, you can use
the older `useThreadMessages` hook instead. However, working with UIMessages
enables richer streaming capabilities, such as status on whether the agent is
actively reasoning.

### UIMessage type

The Agent component extends the AI SDK's `UIMessage` type to provide convenient
metadata for rendering messages.

The core UIMessage type from the AI SDK is:

- `parts` is an array of parts (e.g. "text", "file", "image", "toolCall",
  "toolResult")
- `content` is a string of the message content.
- `role` is the role of the message (e.g. "user", "assistant", "system").

The helper adds these additional fields:

- `key` is a unique identifier for the message.
- `order` is the order of the message in the thread.
- `stepOrder` is the step order of the message in the thread.
- `status` is the status of the message (or "streaming").
- `agentName` is the name of the agent that generated the message.
- `text` is the text of the message.
- `_creationTime` is the timestamp of the message. For streaming messages, it's
  currently assigned to the current time on the streaming client.

To reference these, ensure you're importing `UIMessage` from
`@convex-dev/agent`.

#### `toUIMessages` helper

`toUIMessages` is a helper function that transforms MessageDocs into AI SDK
"UIMessage"s. This is a convenient data model for displaying messages.

If you are using `useThreadMessages` for instance, you can convert the messages
to UIMessages like this:

```ts
import { toUIMessages, type UIMessage } from "@convex-dev/agent";

...
const { results } = useThreadMessages(...);
const uiMessages = toUIMessages(results);
```

### Optimistic updates for sending messages

The `optimisticallySendMessage` function is a helper function for sending a
message, so you can optimistically show a message in the message list until the
mutation has completed on the server.

Pass in the query that you're using to list messages, and it will insert the
ephemeral message at the top of the list.

```ts
const sendMessage = useMutation(
  api.streaming.streamStoryAsynchronously,
).withOptimisticUpdate(
  optimisticallySendMessage(api.streaming.listThreadMessages),
);
```

If your arguments don't include `{ threadId, prompt }` then you can use it as a
helper function in your optimistic update:

```ts
import { optimisticallySendMessage } from "@convex-dev/agent/react";

const sendMessage = useMutation(
  api.chatStreaming.streamStoryAsynchronously,
).withOptimisticUpdate(
  (store, args) => {
    optimisticallySendMessage(api.chatStreaming.listThreadMessages)(store, {
      threadId:
      prompt: /* change your args into the user prompt. */,
    })
  }
);
```

## Saving messages

By default, the Agent will save messages to the database automatically when you
provide them as a prompt, as well as all generated messages.

However, it is useful to save the prompt message ahead of time and use the
`promptMessageId` to continue the conversation. See [Agents](./agents.mdx) for
more details.

You can save messages to the database manually using `saveMessage` or
`saveMessages`, either on the Agent class or as a direct function call.

- You can pass a `prompt` or a full `message` (`ModelMessage` type)
- The `metadata` argument is optional and allows you to provide more details,
  such as `sources`, `reasoningDetails`, `usage`, `warnings`, `error`, etc.

```ts
const { messageId } = await saveMessage(ctx, components.agent, {
  threadId,
  userId,
  message: { role: "user", content: "The user message" },
});
```

Note: when calling `agent.generateText` with the raw prompt, embeddings are
generated automatically for vector search (if you have a text embedding model
configured). Similarly with `agent.saveMessage` when calling from an action.
However, if you're saving messages in a mutation, where calling an LLM is not
possible, it will generate them automatically if `generateText` receives a
`promptMessageId` that lacks an embedding (and you have a text embedding model
configured).

### Without the Agent class:

Note: If you aren't using the Agent class with a text embedding model set, you
need to pass an `embedding` if you want to save it at the same time.

```ts
import { saveMessage } from "@convex-dev/agent";

const { messageId } = await saveMessage(ctx, components.agent, {
  threadId,
  userId,
  message: { role: "assistant", content: result },
  metadata: [{ reasoning, usage, ... }] // See MessageWithMetadata type
  agentName: "my-agent",
  embedding: { vector: [0.1, 0.2, ...], model: "text-embedding-3-small" },
});
```

### Using the Agent class:

```ts
const { messageId } = await agent.saveMessage(ctx, {
  threadId,
  userId,
  prompt,
  metadata,
});
```

```ts
const { messages } = await agent.saveMessages(ctx, {
  threadId, userId,
  messages: [{ role, content }],
  metadata: [{ reasoning, usage, ... }] // See MessageWithMetadata type
});
```

If you are saving the message in a mutation and you have a text embedding model
set, pass `skipEmbeddings: true`. The embeddings for the message will be
generated lazily if the message is used as a prompt. Or you can provide an
embedding upfront if it's available, or later explicitly generate them using
`agent.generateEmbeddings`.

## Configuring the storage of messages

Generally the defaults are fine, but if you want to pass in multiple messages
and have them all saved (vs. just the last one), or avoid saving any input or
output messages, you can pass in a `storageOptions` object, either to the Agent
constructor or per-message.

The use-case for passing in multiple messages but not saving them is if you want
to include some extra messages for context to the LLM, but only the last message
is the user's actual request. e.g.
`messages = [...messagesFromRag, messageFromUser]`. The default is to save the
prompt and all output messages.

```ts
const result = await thread.generateText({ messages }, {
  storageOptions: {
    saveMessages: "all" | "none" | "promptAndOutput";
  },
});
```

## Message ordering

Each message has `order` and `stepOrder` fields, which are incrementing integers
specific to a thread.

When `saveMessage` or `generateText` is called, the message is added to the
thread's next `order` with a `stepOrder` of 0.

As response message(s) are generated in response to that message, they are added
at the same `order` with the next `stepOrder`.

To associate a response message with a previous message, you can pass in the
`promptMessageId` to `generateText` and others.

Note: if the `promptMessageId` is not the latest message in the thread, the
context for the message generation will not include any messages following the
`promptMessageId`.

## Deleting messages

You can delete messages by their `_id` (returned from `saveMessage` or
`generateText`) or `order` / `stepOrder`.

By ID:

```ts
await agent.deleteMessage(ctx, { messageId });
// batch delete
await agent.deleteMessages(ctx, { messageIds });
```

By order (start is inclusive, end is exclusive):

```ts
// Delete all messages with the same order as a given message:
await agent.deleteMessageRange(ctx, {
  threadId,
  startOrder: message.order,
  endOrder: message.order + 1,
});
// Delete all messages with order 1 or 2.
await agent.deleteMessageRange(ctx, { threadId, startOrder: 1, endOrder: 3 });
// Delete all messages with order 1 and stepOrder 2-4
await agent.deleteMessageRange(ctx, {
  threadId,
  startOrder: 1,
  startStepOrder: 2,
  endOrder: 2,
  endStepOrder: 5,
});
```

## Other utilities:

```ts
import { ... } from "@convex-dev/agent";
```

- `serializeDataOrUrl` is a utility function that serializes an AI SDK
  `DataContent` or `URL` to a Convex-serializable format.
- `filterOutOrphanedToolMessages` is a utility function that filters out tool
  call messages that don't have a corresponding tool result message.
- `extractText` is a utility function that extracts text from a
  `ModelMessage`-like object.

### Validators and types

There are types to validate and provide types for various values

```ts
import { ... } from "@convex-dev/agent";
```

- `vMessage` is a validator for a `ModelMessage`-like object (with a `role` and
  `content` field e.g.).
- `MessageDoc` and `vMessageDoc` are the types for a message (which includes a
  `.message` field with the `vMessage` type).
- `Thread` is the type of a thread returned from `continueThread` or
  `createThread`.
- `ThreadDoc` and `vThreadDoc` are the types for thread metadata.
- `AgentComponent` is the type of the installed component (e.g.
  `components.agent`).
- `ToolCtx` is the `ctx` type for calls to `createTool` tools.
