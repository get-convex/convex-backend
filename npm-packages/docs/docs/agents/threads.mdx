Threads are a way to group messages together in a linear history. All messages
saved in the Agent component are associated with a thread. When a message is
generated based on a prompt, it saves the user message and generated agent
message(s) automatically.

Threads can be associated with a user, and messages can each individually be
associated with a user. By default, messages are associated with the thread's
user.

## Creating a thread

You can create a thread in a mutation or action. If you create it in an action,
it will also return a `thread` (see below) and you can start calling LLMs and
generating messages. If you specify a userId, the thread will be associated with
that user and messages will be saved to the user's history.

```ts
import { createThread } from "@convex-dev/agent";

const threadId = await createThread(ctx, components.agent);
```

You may also pass in metadata to set on the thread:

```ts
const userId = await getAuthUserId(ctx);
const threadId = await createThread(ctx, components.agent, {
  userId,
  title: "My thread",
  summary: "This is a summary of the thread",
});
```

Metadata may be provided as context to the agent automatically in the future,
but for now it's a convenience that helps organize threads in the
[Playground](./playground.mdx).

## Generating a message in a thread

You can generate a message in a thread via the agent functions:
`agent.generateText`, `agent.generateObject`, `agent.streamText`, and
`agent.streamObject`. Any agent can generate a message in a thread created by
any other agent.

```ts
const agent = new Agent(components.agent, { languageModel, instructions });

export const generateReplyToPrompt = action({
  args: { prompt: v.string(), threadId: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, { prompt, threadId }) => {
    // await authorizeThreadAccess(ctx, threadId);
    const result = await agent.generateText(ctx, { threadId }, { prompt });
    return result.text;
  },
});
```

See [Messages](./messages.mdx) for more details on creating and saving messages.

## Continuing a thread using the `thread` object from `agent.continueThread`

You can also continue a thread by creating an agent-specific `thread` object,
either when calling `agent.createThread` or `agent.continueThread` from within
an action. This allows calling methods without specifying those parameters each
time.

```ts
const { thread } = await agent.continueThread(ctx, { threadId });
const result = await thread.generateText({ prompt });
```

The `thread` from `continueThread` or `createThread` (available in actions only)
is a `Thread` object, which has convenience methods that are thread-specific:

- `thread.getMetadata()` to get the `userId`, `title`, `summary` etc.
- `thread.updateMetadata({ patch: { title, summary, userId} })` to update the
  metadata
- `thread.generateText({ prompt, ... })` - equivalent to
  `agent.generateText(ctx, { threadId }, { prompt, ... })`
- `thread.streamText({ prompt, ... })` - equivalent to
  `agent.streamText(ctx, { threadId }, { prompt, ... })`
- `thread.generateObject({ prompt, ... })` - equivalent to
  `agent.generateObject(ctx, { threadId }, { prompt, ... })`
- `thread.streamObject({ prompt, ... })` - equivalent to
  `agent.streamObject(ctx, { threadId }, { prompt, ... })`

See [Messages docs](./messages.mdx) for more details on generating messages.

## Deleting threads

You can delete threads by their `threadId`.

Asynchronously (from a mutation or action):

```ts
await agent.deleteThreadAsync(ctx, { threadId });
```

Synchronously in batches (from an action):

```ts
await agent.deleteThreadSync(ctx, { threadId });
```

You can also delete all threads by a user by their `userId`.

```ts
await agent.deleteThreadsByUserId(ctx, { userId });
```

## Getting all threads owned by a user

```ts
const threads = await ctx.runQuery(
  components.agent.threads.listThreadsByUserId,
  { userId, paginationOpts: args.paginationOpts },
);
```

## Deleting all threads and messages associated with a user

Asynchronously (from a mutation or action):

```ts
await ctx.runMutation(components.agent.users.deleteAllForUserIdAsync, {
  userId,
});
```

Synchronously (from an action):

```ts
await ctx.runMutation(components.agent.users.deleteAllForUserId, { userId });
```

## Getting messages in a thread

See [messages.mdx](./messages.mdx) for more details.

```ts
import { listMessages } from "@convex-dev/agent";

const messages = await listMessages(ctx, components.agent, {
  threadId,
  excludeToolMessages: true,
  paginationOpts: { cursor: null, numItems: 10 }, // null means start from the beginning
});
```
