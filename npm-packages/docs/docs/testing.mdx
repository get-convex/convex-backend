Convex makes it easy to test your app via automated tests running in JS or
against a real backend, and manually in dev, preview and staging environments.

## Automated tests

### `convex-test` library

[Use the `convex-test` library](/docs/testing/convex-test.mdx) to test your
functions in JS via the excellent Vitest testing framework.

### Testing against a real backend

Convex open source builds allow you to test all of your backend logic running on
a real [local Convex backend](/docs/testing/convex-backend.mdx).

### Set up testing in CI

It's a good idea to test your app continuously in a controlled environment. No
matter which way automated method you use, it's easy to run them with
[Github Actions](/docs/testing/ci.mdx).

## Manual tests

### Running a function in dev

Manually run a function in dev to quickly see if things are working:

- [Run functions from the command line](/docs/cli.md#run-convex-functions)
- [Run functions from the dashboard](/docs/dashboard/deployments/functions.md#running-functions)

### Preview deployments

[Use preview deployments](/docs/production/hosting/preview-deployments.mdx) to
get early feedback from your team for your in-progress features.

### Staging environment

You can set up a separate project as a staging environment to test against. See
[Deploying Your App to Production](/docs/production.mdx#staging-environment).
