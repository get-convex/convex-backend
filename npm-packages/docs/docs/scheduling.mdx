Convex lets you easily schedule a function to run once or repeatedly in the
future. This allows you to build durable workflows like sending a welcome email
a day after someone joins or regularly reconciling your accounts with Stripe.
Convex provides two different features for scheduling:

- [Scheduled Functions](/docs/scheduling/scheduled-functions.mdx) can be
  scheduled durably by any other function to run at a later point in time. You
  can schedule functions minutes, days, and even months in the future.
- [Cron Jobs](/docs/scheduling/cron-jobs.mdx) schedule functions to run on a
  recurring basis, such as daily.

## Durable function components

Built-in scheduled functions and crons work well for simpler apps and workflows.
If you're operating at high scale or need more specific guarantees, use the
following higher-level [components](/docs/components.mdx) for durable functions.
