The easiest way to publish your full-stack web app is to use a hosting provider
like [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

Both Vercel and Netlify integrate with Git to deploy code whenever a new
revision is pushed. To host your app:

1. Commit all files and push to your favorite Git hosting provider such as
   [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or
   [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

2. Follow the appropriate guide below.

If you aren't using Netlify or Vercel, you can follow the Custom Hosting guide.
