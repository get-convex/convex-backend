Convex preview deployments allow your team to test out backend changes before
pushing them to production.

In combination with Vercel Preview Deployments or Netlify Deploy Previews, you
can preview both frontend and backend changes together.

<ProFeatureUpsell feature="Convex preview deployments" verb="require" />

<BetaAdmonition feature="Convex preview deployments" verb="are" />

## Setup

Follow the [Vercel](/production/hosting/vercel.mdx#preview-deployments) or
[Netlify](/production/hosting/netlify.mdx#deploy-previews) hosting guide for
setting up frontend and backend previews together, as well as details on how
Convex preview deployments work.

See `npx convex deploy --help` for all available options for
`npx convex deploy`.

## Limits

Convex preview deployments are automatically cleaned up 14 days after creation,
or when a new preview deployment with the same name is created. They can also be
manually deleted from the Convex dashboard.

When a Convex preview deployment is deleted, the Vercel/Netlify preview link
will open and show UI, but will be unable to run any Convex functions since it
is pointing at a Convex deployment that no longer exists. In these cases,
re-deploying in Vercel/Netlify should produce a link pointing at a new Convex
deployment.

Convex allows a single deployment at a time for a given name (Git branch). When
pushing updates to an existing branch, the deployment will be deleted, resulting
in a preview link unable to run Convex functions, before it is replaced by a new
Convex deployment.

Initial data can be set up on a Convex preview deployment by running a function.
There are currently no other ways to set up data on a Convex preview deployment
-- viewing changes against a copy of production data or importing data from a
different Convex deployment is not supported.

Note that if the function call fails, the `deploy` command will fail, but the
new preview deployment will have already been provisioned. Best course of action
is to fix the issue in the function and redeploy.

Support for preview deployments is a beta feature, so
[let us know on Discord](https://convex.dev/community) if you have feedback!
