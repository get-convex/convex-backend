## Custom Domains

You can configure a custom domain, like `api.example.com`, to serve HTTP actions
or Convex functions from your production Convex deployments. The settings for
this feature are accessed through the Project Settings page on any of your
projects.

After you enter a domain, you will be shown which records to set on your DNS
provider. Some popular DNS providers that you can use to buy a domain are
Cloudflare and GoDaddy. We will verify your domain in the background, and once
these records are set, you will see a green checkmark.

When you see that checkmark, your backend will now serve traffic from that
domain. The first request may take up to a minute because Convex will have to
mint a new SSL certificate.

Reach out to support@convex.dev if you have any questions about getting set up!

### Hosting with a Custom Domain

To use a custom domain to serve your Convex functions, you'll need additional
configuration in your hosting provider.

The standard build command, `npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'`, will
automatically handle setting the `CONVEX_URL` environment variable (or similarly
named) to the `.convex.cloud` URL for your production deployment, overriding any
other value you have set.

If you're using a custom domain, you'll want to set a different environment
variable in your hosting provider to have the value of your custom domain in the
production environment:
![Vercel import project](/screenshots/vercel_custom_domain.png)

Switch the code that instantiates your Convex client to prefer this new value:

```tsx
new ConvexReactClient(
  import.meta.env.VITE_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_CONVEX_URL ??
    import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL,
);
```

You can confirm this works by checking the network tab in your browser's
developer tools.

## Custom Hosting

If you're using only Convex for backend functionality you can host your web app
on any static hosting provider. This guide will use
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as an example.

If you're using Next.js or other framework with server functionality you'll need
to use a provider that supports it, such as
[Netlify](/docs/production/hosting/netlify.mdx) or
[Vercel](/docs/production/hosting/vercel.mdx). You can still host Next.js
statically via a
[static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).

### Configure your build

First make sure that you have a working build process.

In this guide we'll set up a local build, but your hosting provider might
support a remote build. For example see
[Vite's Deploying to GitHub Pages guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages)
which uses GitHub actions.

We'll use Vite and GitHub Pages as an example.

1. Configure <JSDialectFileName name="vite.config.mts" />:

   ```ts title="vite.config.mts"
   import { defineConfig } from "vite";
   import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

   // https://vitejs.dev/config/
   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [react()],
     // highlight-next-line
     build: {
       // highlight-next-line
       outDir: "docs",
       // highlight-next-line
     },
     // highlight-next-line
     base: "/some-repo-name/",
   });
   ```

   The `build.outDir` field specifies where Vite will place the production
   build, and we use `docs` because that's the directory GitHub Pages allow
   hosting from.

   The `base` field specifies the URL path under which you'll serve your app, in
   this case we will serve on
   `https://<some username>.github.io/<some repo name>`.

### Configure your hosting provider

With GitHub Pages, you can choose whether you want to include your build output
in your main working branch or publish from a separate branch.

Open your repository's GitHub page > _Settings_ > _Pages_. Under _Build and
deployment_ > _Source_ choose `Deploy from a branch`.

Under _branch_ choose a branch (if you want to use a separate branch, push at
least one commit to it first), and the `/docs` folder name. Hit _Save_.

### Build and deploy to Convex and GitHub Pages

To manually deploy to GitHub pages follow these steps:

1. Checkout the branch you chose to publish from
2. Run `npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'` and confirm that you want to
   push your current backend code to your **production** deployment
3. Commit the build output changes and push to GitHub.

### How it works

First, `npx convex deploy` runs through these steps:

1. It sets the `VITE_CONVEX_URL` (or similarly named) environment variable to
   your **production** Convex deployment.
2. It invokes the frontend framework build process, via `npm run build`. The
   build process reads the environment variable and uses it to point the built
   site at your **production** deployment.
3. It deploys your backend code, from the `convex` directory, to your
   **production** deployment.

Afterwards you deploy the built frontend code to your hosting provider. In this
case you used Git, but for other providers you might use a different method,
such as an old-school FTP request.

You can use `--cmd-url-env-var-name` to customize the variable name used by your
frontend code if the `deploy` command cannot infer it, like

```sh
npx convex deploy --cmd-url-env-var-name CUSTOM_CONVEX_URL --cmd 'npm run build'
```

### Authentication

You will want to configure your [authentication](/docs/auth.mdx) provider
(Clerk, Auth0 or other) to accept your production URL, where your frontend is
served.
