## Local development

When you're developing locally you need two pieces of information:

1. The name of your dev deployment. This is where your functions are pushed to
   and served from. It is stored in the `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` environment
   variable. `npx convex dev` writes it to the `.env.local` file.
2. The URL of your dev deployment, for your client to connect to. The name of
   the variable and which file it can be read from varies between client
   frameworks. `npx convex dev` writes the URL to the `.env.local` or `.env`
   file.

## Production deployment

You should only be deploying to your production deployment once you have tested
your changes on your local deployment. When you're ready, you can deploy either
via a hosting/CI provider or from your local machine.

For a CI environment you can follow the
[hosting](/docs/production/hosting/hosting.mdx) docs. `npx convex deploy` run by
the CI pipeline will use the `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`, and the frontend build command
will use the deployment URL variable, both configured in your CI environment.

You can also deploy your backend from your local machine. `npx convex deploy`
will ask for a confirmation and then deploy to the production deployment in the
same project as your configured development `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT`.

## `convex.json`

Additional project configuration can be specified in the `convex.json` file in
the root of your project (in the same directory as your `package.json`).

The file supports the following configuration options:

### Changing the `convex/` folder name or location

You can choose a different name or location for the `convex/` folder via the
`functions` field. For example, Create React App doesn't allow importing from
outside the `src/` directory, so if you're using Create React App you should
have the following config:

```json title="convex.json"
{
  "functions": "src/convex/"
}
```

### Installing packages on the server

You can specify which packages used by Node actions should be installed on the
server, instead of being bundled, via the `node.externalPackages` field.
[Read more](/docs/functions/bundling.mdx#external-packages).

### Importing the generated functions API via `require()` syntax

The Convex code generation can be configured to generate a CommonJS-version of
the `_generated/api.js` file via the `generateCommonJSApi` field.
[Read more](/docs/client/javascript/node.mdx#javascript-with-commonjs-require-syntax).
