You may select a hosting region for your Convex deployment to change the
location of your data.

All infrastructure powering your deployment will be hosted in the selected
region.

## Available regions

The current available regions are in US East (N. Virginia) and EU West
(Ireland). More regions will be added in the future.

## Selecting a region

When creating a deployment on the Convex dashboard, you will be prompted to
select a region. You may also choose to set the default region for all of your
team's deployments at this time.

[Visit the team settings page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/team/settings) to
change your team's default region.

CLI support for selecting a region for new deployments is coming soon.

## Migrating between regions

An existing deployment's region cannot be changed. If you need to move your
deployment to a different region, you will need to create a new project or
deployment in the desired region and migrate your data by
[exporting](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/import) and
[importing](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/export) your data
with the Convex CLI.
