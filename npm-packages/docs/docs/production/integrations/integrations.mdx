Convex integrates with a variety of supported third party tools for log
streaming and exception reporting.

- [Log Streams](/production/integrations/log-streams) enable streaming of log
  events from your Convex deployment to supported destinations, such as Axiom,
  Datadog, or a custom webhook.
- [Exception Reporting](/production/integrations/exception-reporting) gives
  visibility into errors in your Convex function executions.

## Configuring an Integration

To configure an integration, navigate to the
[Deployment Settings](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/settings) in the
Dashboard, and the "Integrations" tab in the sidebar. This page provides a list
of your configured integrations, their current health status, and other
integrations available to be configured. To configure a integration, click on
the card and follow the setup directions.

## Deleting an Integration

To remove an integration and stop further events from being piped out to the
configured destination, select the menu icon in the upper-right corner of a
configured panel and select "Delete integration". After confirming, the
integration will stop running within a few seconds.

## Integration Components

Beyond integrations for logs and exceptions, [Convex Components](/components)
make it easier to work with third party services. See the full list of
components on the [Convex Components Directory](https://convex.dev/components).
