# Networking

## Egress IP addresses

All outbound requests from your Convex deployment — including
[`fetch`](/functions/actions.mdx) calls in your functions (in both the Convex
and Node.js [runtimes](/functions/runtimes.mdx)), OIDC metadata and JWKS lookups
for [authentication](/auth.mdx),
[log streaming](/production/integrations/log-streams), and other external
connections — originate from the IP addresses listed below.

If you need to configure a firewall or allowlist for an external service to
accept traffic from Convex, add the addresses for your deployment's
[region](/production/regions.mdx).

:::caution

These IP addresses are shared across all Convex deployments in a region, not
just yours. Do not rely on source IP alone to authenticate or authorize incoming
requests.
