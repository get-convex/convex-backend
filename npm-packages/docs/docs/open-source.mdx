The Convex backend, client libraries, and CLI are all open-source. You can
explore everything on the [Convex GitHub page](https://github.com/get-convex).

## Convex Backend

The [open-source Convex Backend](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend)
contains the same fully up-to-date code the cloud service uses. The majority of
the backend is written in Rust, with a healthy dose of TypeScript supporting the
server-side function environment.

We are currently working on open-sourcing the Dashboard, our Postgres bindings,
and better packaging for self-hosting.

You can learn more about open-sourcing at Convex in our
[announcement](https://news.convex.dev/convex-goes-open-source/) and the
[software engineering daily podcast](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2024/03/20/going-open-source-at-convex-with-james-cowling/).
It is released under the [FSL Apache 2.0 License](https://fsl.software/).
