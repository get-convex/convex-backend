On this page

# Errors and Warnings

This page explains specific errors thrown by Convex.

See [Error Handling](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/) to learn
about handling errors in general.

## Write conflict: Optimistic concurrency control [​](https://docs.convex.dev/error\\#1 \"Direct link to Write conflict: Optimistic concurrency control\")

This system error is thrown when a mutation repeatedly fails due to conflicting
changes from parallel mutation executions.

### Example A [​](https://docs.convex.dev/error\\#example-a \"Direct link to Example A\")

A mutation `updateCounter` always updates the same document:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const updateCounter = mutation({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const doc = await ctx.db.get(process.env.COUNTER_ID);
    await ctx.db.patch(doc._id, { value: doc.value + 1 });
  },
});

```

If this mutation is called many times per second, many of its executions will
conflict with each other. Convex internally does several retries to mitigate
this concern, but if the mutation is called more rapidly than Convex can execute
it, some of the invocations will eventually throw this error:

> failure `updateCounter`
>
> Documents read from or written to the table \"counters\" changed while this
> mutation was being run and on every subsequent retry. Another call to this
> mutation changed the document with ID \"123456789101112\".

The error message will note the table name, which mutation caused the conflict
(in this example its another call to the same mutation), and one document ID
which was part of the conflicting change.

### Example B [​](https://docs.convex.dev/error\\#example-b \"Direct link to Example B\")

Mutation `writeCount` depends on the entire `tasks` table:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const writeCount = mutation({
  args: {
    target: v.id(\"counts\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const tasks = await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
    await ctx.db.patch(args.target, { value: tasks });
  },
});

export const addTask = mutation({
  args: {
    text: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    await ctx.db.insert(\"tasks\", { text: args.text });
  },
});

```

If the mutation `writeCount` is called at the same time as many calls to
`addTask` are made, either of the mutations can fail with this error. This is
because any change to the `\"tasks\"` table will conflict with the `writeCount`
mutation:

> failure `writeCount`
>
> Documents read from or written to the table \"tasks\" changed while this
> mutation was being run and on every subsequent retry. A call to \"addTask\"
> changed the document with ID \"123456789101112\".

### Remediation [​](https://docs.convex.dev/error\\#remediation \"Direct link to Remediation\")

To fix this issue:

1. Make sure that your mutations only read the data they need. Consider reducing
the amount of data read by using indexed queries with
[selective index range expressions](https://docs.convex.dev/database/indexes/).
2. Make sure you are not calling a mutation an unexpected number of times,
perhaps from an action inside a loop.
3. Design your data model such that it doesn't require making many writes to the
same document.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/auth#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

Authentication allows you to identify users and restrict what data they can see
and edit.

Convex is compatible with most authentication providers because it uses OpenID
Connect (based on OAuth) ID tokens in the form of JWTs to authenticate WebSocket
connections or RPCs. These JWTs can be provided by any service implementing the
appropriate OAuth endpoints to verify them, including your own Convex backend.

## Third-party authentication platforms [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth\\#third-party-authentication-platforms \"Direct link to Third-party authentication platforms\")

Leveraging a Convex integration with a third-party auth provider provides the
most comprehensive authentication solutions. Integrating another service
provides a ton of functionality like passkeys, two-factor auth, spam protection,
and more on top of the authentication basics.

- [Clerk](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk) is newer and has better Next.js and React Native
support
- [Auth0](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0) is more established with more bells and whistles
- [Custom Auth Integration](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/advanced/custom-auth) allow any
OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider to be used for authentication

After you integrate one of these, learn more about accessing authentication
information in [Functions](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/functions-auth) and storing user
information in the [Database](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth).

## Convex Auth [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth\\#convex-auth \"Direct link to Convex Auth\")

For client-side React and React Native mobile apps you can implement auth
directly in Convex with the [Convex Auth](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/convex-auth) library.
This [npm package](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth) runs on your
Convex deployment and helps you build a custom sign-up/sign-in flow via social
identity providers, one-time email or SMS access codes, or via passwords.

Convex Auth is in beta (it isn't complete and may change in
backward-incompatible ways) and doesn't provide as many features as third party
auth integrations. Since it doesn't require signing up for another service it's
the quickest way to get auth up and running.

Convex Auth is in beta

Convex Authis currently a [beta\\\\
feature](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/#beta-features). If you have feedback or feature
requests, [let us know on Discord](https://convex.dev/community)!

Support for Next.js is under active development. If you'd like to help test this
experimental support please [give it a try](https://labs.convex.dev/auth)!

## Debugging [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth\\#debugging \"Direct link to Debugging\")

If you run into issues consult the [Debugging](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug) guide.

## Service Authentication [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth\\#service-authentication \"Direct link to Service Authentication\")

Servers you control or third party services can call Convex functions but may
not be able to obtain OpenID JWTs and often do not represent the actions of a
specific user.

Say you're running some inference on a [Modal](https://modal.com/) server
written in Python. When that server subscribes to a Convex query it doesn't do
so with credentials of a particular end-user, rather it's looking for relevant
tasks for any users that need that inference task, say summarizing and
translating a conversation, completed.

To provide access to Convex queries, mutations, and actions to an external
service you can write public functions accessible to the internet that check a
shared secret, for example from an environment variable, before doing anything
else.

# Building

`npm pack` produces a public build with internal types removed.



[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

The Convex command-line interface (CLI) is your interface for managing Convex
projects and Convex functions.

To install the CLI, run:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm install convex

```

You can view the full list of commands with:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex

```

## Configure [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#configure \"Direct link to Configure\")

### Create a new project [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#create-a-new-project \"Direct link to Create a new project\")

The first time you run

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dev

```

it will ask you to log in your device and create a new Convex project. It will
then create:

1. The `convex/` directory: This is the home for your query and mutation
functions.
2. `.env.local` with `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` variable: This is the main
configuration for your Convex project. It is the name of your development
deployment.

### Recreate project configuration [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#recreate-project-configuration \"Direct link to Recreate project configuration\")

Run

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dev

```

in a project directory without a set `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` to configure a new or
existing project.

### Log out [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#log-out \"Direct link to Log out\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex logout

```

Remove the existing Convex credentials from your device, so subsequent commands
like `npx convex dev` can use a different Convex account.

## Develop [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#develop \"Direct link to Develop\")

### Run the Convex dev server [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#run-the-convex-dev-server \"Direct link to Run the Convex dev server\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dev

```

Watches the local filesystem. When you change a [function](https://docs.convex.dev/functions)
or the [schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas), the new versions are pushed to your
dev deployment and the [generated types](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/) in `convex/_generated`
are updated.

### Open the dashboard [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#open-the-dashboard \"Direct link to Open the dashboard\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dashboard

```

Open the [Convex dashboard](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard).

### Open the docs [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#open-the-docs \"Direct link to Open the docs\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex docs

```

Get back to these docs!

### Run Convex functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#run-convex-functions \"Direct link to Run Convex functions\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex run <functionName> [args]

```

Run a public or internal Convex query, mutation, or action on your development
deployment.

Arguments are specified as a JSON object.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex run messages:send '{\"body\": \"hello\", \"author\": \"me\"}'

```

Add `--watch` to live update the results of a query. Add `--push` to push local
code to the deployment before running the function.

Use `--prod` to run functions in the production deployment for a project.

### Tail deployment logs [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#tail-deployment-logs \"Direct link to Tail deployment logs\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex logs

```

This pipes logs from your dev deployment to your console. This can be followed
with `--prod` to tail the prod deployment logs instead.

You can also simultaneously deploy code to the Convex dev deployment, watching
for filesystem changes, and pipe logs generated on your dev deployment to your
console:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dev --tail-logs

```

### Import data from a file [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#import-data-from-a-file \"Direct link to Import data from a file\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex import --table <tableName> <path>
npx convex import <path>.zip

```

See description and use-cases:
[data import](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/import).

### Export data to a file [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#export-data-to-a-file \"Direct link to Export data to a file\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex export --path <directoryPath>
npx convex export --path <filePath>.zip
npx convex export --include-file-storage --path <path>

```

See description and use-cases:
[data export](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/export).

### Display data from tables [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#display-data-from-tables \"Direct link to Display data from tables\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex data  # lists tables
npx convex data <table>

```

Display a simple view of the
[dashboard data page](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/data) in the command line.

The command supports `--limit` and `--order` flags to change data displayed. For
more complex filters, use the dashboard data page or write a
[query](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/).

The `npx convex data <table>` command works with
[system tables](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/system-tables), such as `_storage`, in
addition to your own tables.

### Read and write environment variables [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#read-and-write-environment-variables \"Direct link to Read and write environment variables\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex env list
npx convex env get <name>
npx convex env set <name> <value>
npx convex env remove <name>

```

See and update the deployment environment variables which you can otherwise
manage on the dashboard
[environment variables settings page](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/deployment-settings#environment-variables).

## Deploy [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#deploy \"Direct link to Deploy\")

### Deploy Convex functions to production [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#deploy-convex-functions-to-production \"Direct link to Deploy Convex functions to production\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy

```

The target deployment to push to is determined like this:

1. If the `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` environment variable is set (typical in CI), then
it is the deployment associated with that key.
2. If the `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable is set (typical during local
development), then the target deployment is the production deployment of the
project that the deployment specified by `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` belongs to. This
allows you to deploy to your prod deployment while developing against your
dev deployment.

This command will:

1. Run a command if specified with `--cmd`. The command will have CONVEX\\_URL (or
similar) environment variable available:




```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy --cmd \"npm run build\"

```








You can customize the URL environment variable name with
`--cmd-url-env-var-name`:




```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build' --cmd-url-env-var-name CUSTOM_CONVEX_URL

```

2. Typecheck your Convex functions.
3. Regenerate the [generated code](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/) in the `convex/_generated`
directory.
4. Bundle your Convex functions and their dependencies.
5. Push your functions,
[indexes](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/), and
[schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) to production.

Once this command succeeds the new functions will be available immediately.

### Deploy Convex functions to a [preview deployment](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/preview-deployments) [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#deploy-convex-functions-to-a-preview-deployment \"Direct link to deploy-convex-functions-to-a-preview-deployment\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy

```

When run with the `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` environment variable containing a Preview
Deploy Key, this command will:

1. Create a deployment with the specified name. `npx convex deploy` will infer
the Git branch name for Vercel, Netlify, GitHub, and GitLab environments, but
the `--preview-create` option can be used to customize the name associated
with the newly created deployment.





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy --preview-create my-branch-name

```

2. Run a command if specified with `--cmd`. The command will have CONVEX\\_URL (or
similar) environment variable available:





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy --cmd \"npm run build\"

```









You can customize the URL environment variable name with
`--cmd-url-env-var-name`:





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build' --cmd-url-env-var-name CUSTOM_CONVEX_URL

```

3. Typecheck your Convex functions.

4. Regenerate the [generated code](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/) in the `convex/_generated`
directory.

5. Bundle your Convex functions and their dependencies.

6. Push your functions,
[indexes](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/), and
[schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) to the deployment.

7. Run a function specified by `--preview-run` (similar to the `--run` option
for `npx convex dev`).





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy --preview-run myFunction

```


See the [Vercel](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/vercel#preview-deployments) or
[Netlify](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/netlify#deploy-previews) hosting guide
for setting up frontend and backend previews together.

### Update generated code [​](https://docs.convex.dev/cli\\#update-generated-code \"Direct link to Update generated code\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex codegen

```

Update the [generated code](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/) in `convex/_generated` without
pushing. This can be useful for orchestrating build steps in CI.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/database#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

The Convex database provides a relational data model, stores JSON-like
documents, and can be used with or without a schema. It \"just works,\" giving you
predictable query performance in an easy-to-use interface.

Query and mutation [functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions) read and write data through
a lightweight JavaScript API. There is nothing to set up and no need to write
any SQL. Just use JavaScript to express your app's needs.

Start by learning about the basics of [tables](https://docs.convex.dev/database#tables), [documents](https://docs.convex.dev/database#documents)
and [schemas](https://docs.convex.dev/database#schemas) below, then move on to
[Reading Data](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/) and
[Writing Data](https://docs.convex.dev/database/writing-data).

As your app grows more complex you'll need more from your database:

- Relational data modeling with [Document IDs](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids)
- Fast querying with [Indexes](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/)
- Exposing large datasets with
[Paginated Queries](https://docs.convex.dev/database/pagination)
- Type safety by [Defining a Schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas)
- Interoperability with data
[Import & Export](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/)

## Tables [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database\\#tables \"Direct link to Tables\")

Your Convex deployment contains tables that hold your app's data. Initially,
your deployment contains no tables or documents.

Each table springs into existence as soon as you add the first document to it.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// `friends` table doesn't exist.
await ctx.db.insert(\"friends\", { name: \"Jamie\" });
// Now it does, and it has one document.

```

You do not have to specify a schema upfront or create tables explicitly.

## Documents [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database\\#documents \"Direct link to Documents\")

Tables contain documents. Documents are very similar to JavaScript objects. They
have fields and values, and you can nest arrays or objects within them.

These are all valid Convex documents:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{}
{\"name\": \"Jamie\"}
{\"name\": {\"first\": \"Ari\", \"second\": \"Cole\"}, \"age\": 60}

```

They can also contain references to other documents in other tables. See
[Data Types](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types) to learn more about the types supported in
Convex and [Document IDs](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids) to learn about how to
use those types to model your data.

## Schemas [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database\\#schemas \"Direct link to Schemas\")

Though optional, schemas ensure that your data looks exactly how you want. For a
simple chat app, the schema will look like this:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from \"convex/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

// @snippet start schema
export default defineSchema({
  messages: defineTable({
    author: v.id(\"users\"),
    body: v.string(),
  }),
});

```

You can choose to be as flexible as you want by using types such as `v.any()` or
as specific as you want by precisely describing a `v.object()`.

See [the schema documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) to learn more about
schemas.

On this page

_If you're using Convex Auth, see the_
_[authorization doc](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/authz#use-authentication-state-in-backend-functions)._

Within a Convex [function](https://docs.convex.dev/functions), you can access information
about the currently logged-in user by using the
[`auth`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Auth) property of the
[`QueryCtx`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericQueryCtx),
[`MutationCtx`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericMutationCtx), or
[`ActionCtx`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server#actionctx) object:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const myMutation = mutation({
  args: {
    // ...
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (identity === null) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthenticated call to mutation\");
    }
    //...
  },
});

```

## User identity fields [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/functions-auth\\#user-identity-fields \"Direct link to User identity fields\")

The [UserIdentity](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.UserIdentity) object returned by
`getUserIdentity` is guaranteed to have `tokenIdentifier`, `subject` and
`issuer` fields. Which other fields it will include depends on the identity
provider used and the configuration of JWT tokens and
[OpenID scopes](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims).

`tokenIdentifier` is a combination of `subject` and `issuer` to ensure
uniqueness even when multiple providers are used.

If you followed one of our integrations with Clerk or Auth0 at least the
following fields will be present: `familyName`, `givenName`, `nickname`,
`pictureUrl`, `updatedAt`, `email`, `emailVerified`. See their corresponding
standard definition in the
[OpenID docs](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims).

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const myMutation = mutation({
  args: {
    // ...
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    const { tokenIdentifier, name, email } = identity!;
    //...
  },
});

```

### Clerk claims configuration [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/functions-auth\\#clerk-claims-configuration \"Direct link to Clerk claims configuration\")

If you're using Clerk, the fields returned by `getUserIdentity` are determined
by your JWT template's _Claims_ config. If you've set custom claims, they will
be returned by `getUserIdentity` as well.

## HTTP Actions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/functions-auth\\#http-actions \"Direct link to HTTP Actions\")

You can also access the user identity from an HTTP action
[`ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Auth#getuseridentity), by
calling your endpoint with an `Authorization` header including a JWT token:

myPage.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const jwtToken = \"...\";

fetch(\"https://<deployment name>.convex.site/myAction\", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${jwtToken}`,
  },
});

```

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/remix#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

Learn how to query data from Convex in a Remix app.

1. Create a Remix site



Create a Remix site using the `npx create-remix@latest` command.













```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx create-remix@latest my-remix-app

```

2. Install the Convex library



To get started, install the `convex` package.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
cd my-remix-app && npm install convex

```

3. Set up a Convex dev deployment



Next, run `npx convex dev`. This
will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.



It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
will then continue running to sync your functions
with your dev deployment in the cloud.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dev

```

4. Create sample data for your database



In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl`
file with some sample data.









sampleData.jsonl





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
{\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
{\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

```

5. Add the sample data to your database



Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table
with the sample data into your Convex database with
the `import` command.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

```

6. Expose a database query



Add a new file `tasks.ts` in the `convex/` folder
with a query function that loads the data.



Exporting a query function from this file
declares an API function named after the file
and the export name, `api.tasks.get`.









convex/tasks.ts





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const get = query({
     args: {},
     handler: async (ctx) => {
       return await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
     },
});

```

7. Wire up the ConvexProvider



Modify `app/root.tsx` to set up the Convex client there to make it available on every page of your app.









app/root.tsx





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import {
     Links,
     Meta,
     Outlet,
     Scripts,
     ScrollRestoration,
     json,
     useLoaderData,
} from \"@remix-run/react\";
import { ConvexProvider, ConvexReactClient } from \"convex/react\";
import { useState } from \"react\";

export async function loader() {
     const CONVEX_URL = process.env[\"CONVEX_URL\"]!;
     return json({ ENV: { CONVEX_URL } });
}

export function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
     const { ENV } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();
     const [convex] = useState(() => new ConvexReactClient(ENV.CONVEX_URL));
     return (
       <html lang=\"en\">
         <head>
           <meta charSet=\"utf-8\" />
           <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />
           <Meta />
           <Links />
         </head>
         <body>
           <ConvexProvider client={convex}>{children}</ConvexProvider>
           <ScrollRestoration />
           <Scripts />
         </body>
       </html>
     );
}

export default function App() {
     return <Outlet />;
}

```

8. Display the data in your app



In `app/routes/_index.tsx` use `useQuery` to subscribe your `api.tasks.get`
API function.









app/routes/\\_index.tsx





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import type { MetaFunction } from \"@remix-run/node\";
import { api } from \"convex/_generated/api\";
import { useQuery } from \"convex/react\";

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => {
     return [\\
       { title: \"New Remix App\" },\\
       { name: \"description\", content: \"Welcome to Remix!\" },\\
     ];
};

export default function Index() {
     const tasks = useQuery(api.tasks.get);
     return (
       <div style={{ fontFamily: \"system-ui, sans-serif\", lineHeight: \"1.8\" }}>
         <h1>Welcome to Remix</h1>
         {tasks === undefined
           ? \"loading...\"
           : tasks.map(({ _id, text }) => <div key={_id}>{text}</div>)}
       </div>
     );
}

```

9. Start the app



Start the app, open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) in a browser,
and see the list of tasks.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm run dev

```

# Debugging Authentication

You have followed one of our authentication guides but something is not working.
You have double checked that you followed all the steps, and that you used the
correct secrets, but you are still stuck.

## Frequently encountered issues [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug\\#frequently-encountered-issues \"Direct link to Frequently encountered issues\")

### `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` returns `null` in a query [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug\\#ctxauthgetuseridentity-returns-null-in-a-query \"Direct link to ctxauthgetuseridentity-returns-null-in-a-query\")

This often happens when subscribing to queries via `useQuery` in React, without
waiting for the client to be authenticated. Even if the user has been logged-in
previously, it takes some time for the client to authenticate with the Convex
backend. Therefore on page load, `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` called within a
query returns `null`.

To handle this, you can either:

1. Use the `Authenticated` component from `convex/react` to wrap the component
that includes the `useQuery` call (see the last two steps in the
[Clerk guide](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk#get-started))
2. Or return `null` or some other \"sentinel\" value from the query and handle it
on the client

If you are using `fetchQuery` for
[Next.js Server Rendering](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs/server-rendering),
make sure you are explicitly passing in a JWT token as documented
[here](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs/server-rendering#server-side-authentication).

If this hasn't helped, follow the steps below to resolve your issue.

## Step 1: Check whether authentication works on the backend [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug\\#step-1-check-whether-authentication-works-on-the-backend \"Direct link to Step 1: Check whether authentication works on the backend\")

1. Add the following code to the _beginning_ of your function (query, mutation,
action or http action):

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
console.log(\"server identity\", await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity());

```

2. Then call this function from whichever client you're using to talk to Convex.

3. Open the
[logs page on your dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/logs).

4. What do you see on the logs page?

**Answer: I don't see anything**:


   - Potential cause: You don't have the right dashboard open. Confirm that the
     Deployment URL on _Settings_ \\> _URL and Deploy Key_ page matches how your
     client is configured.
   - Potential cause: Your client is not connected to Convex. Check your client
     logs (browser logs) for errors. Reload the page / restart the client.
   - Potential cause: The code has not been pushed. For dev deployments make
     sure you have `npx convex dev` running. For prod deployments make sure you
     successfully pushed via `npx convex deploy`. Go to the _Functions_ page on
     the dashboard and check that the code shown there includes the
     `console.log` line you added.

When you resolved the cause you should see the log appear.

**Answer: I see a log with `'server identity' null`**:

   - Potential cause: The client is not supplying an auth token.
   - Potential cause: Your deployment is misconfigured.
   - Potential cause: Your client is misconfigured.

Proceed to
[step 2](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug#step-2-check-whether-authentication-works-on-the-frontend).

**Answer: I see a log with `'server identity' { tokenIdentifier: '... } `**

Great, you are all set!

## Step 2: Check whether authentication works on the frontend [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug\\#step-2-check-whether-authentication-works-on-the-frontend \"Direct link to Step 2: Check whether authentication works on the frontend\")

No matter which client you use, it must pass a JWT token to your backend for
authentication to work.

The most bullet-proof way of ensuring your client is passing the token to the
backend, is to inspect the traffic between them.

1. If you're using a client from the web browser, open the _Network_ tab in your
browser's developer tools.

2. Check the token
   - For Websocket-based clients ( `ConvexReactClient` and `ConvexClient`),
     filter for the `sync` name and select `WS` as the type of traffic. Check
     the `sync` items. After the client is initialized (commonly after loading
     the page), it will send a message (check the _Messages_ tab) with
     `type: \"Authenticate\"`, and `value` will be the authentication token.

     ![Network tab inspecting Websocket messages](https://docs.convex.dev/screenshots/auth-ws.png)

   - For HTTP based clients ( `ConvexHTTPClient` and the
     [HTTP API](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api/)), select `Fetch/XHR` as the type of
     traffic. You should see an individual network request for each function
     call, with an `Authorization` header with value `Bearer ` followed by the
     authentication token.

     ![Network tab inspecting HTTP headers](https://docs.convex.dev/screenshots/auth-http.png)
3. Do you see the authentication token in the traffic?

**Answer: No**:


   - Potential cause: The Convex client is not configured to get/fetch a JWT
     token. You're not using
     `ConvexProviderWithClerk`/ `ConvexProviderWithAuth0`/ `ConvexProviderWithAuth`
     with the `ConvexReactClient` or you forgot to call `setAuth` on
     `ConvexHTTPClient` or `ConvexClient`.

   - Potential cause: You are not signed in, so the token is `null` or
     `undefined` and the `ConvexReactClient` skipped authentication altogether.
     Verify that you are signed in via `console.log` ing the token from whichever
     auth provider you are using:


     - Clerk:





       ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
       // import { useAuth } from \"@clerk/nextjs\"; // for Next.js
       import { useAuth } from \"@clerk/clerk-react\";

       const { getToken } = useAuth();
       console.log(getToken({ template: \"convex\" }));

       ```

     - Auth0:





       ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
       import { useAuth0 } from \"@auth0/auth0-react\";

       const { getAccessTokenSilently } = useAuth0();
       const response = await getAccessTokenSilently({
         detailedResponse: true,
       });
       const token = response.id_token;
       console.log(token);

       ```

     - Custom: However you implemented `useAuthFromProviderX`


If you don't see a long string that looks like a token, check the browser
logs for errors from your auth provider. If there are none, check the
Network tab to see whether requests to your provider are failing. Perhaps
the auth provider is misconfigured. Double check the auth provider
configuration (in the corresponding React provider or however your auth
provider is configured for the client). Try clearing your cookies in the
browser (in dev tools _Application_ \\> _Cookies_ \\> _Clear all cookies_
button).

**Answer: Yes, I see a long string that looks like a JWT**:

Great, copy the whole token (there can be `.` s in it, so make sure you're not
copying just a portion of it).

4. Open [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/), scroll down and paste the token in the Encoded textarea
on the left of the page. On the right you should see:


   - In _HEADER_, `\"typ\": \"JWT\"`
   - in _PAYLOAD_, a valid JSON with at least `\"aud\"`, `\"iss\"` and `\"sub\"`
     fields. If you see gibberish in the payload you probably didn't copy the
     token correctly or it's not a valid JWT token.

If you see a valid JWT token, repeat
[step 1](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug#step-1-check-whether-authentication-works-on-the-backend). If you
still don't see correct identity, proceed to step 3.

## Step 3: Check that backend configuration matches frontend configuration [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug\\#step-3-check-that-backend-configuration-matches-frontend-configuration \"Direct link to Step 3: Check that backend configuration matches frontend configuration\")

You have a valid JWT token on the frontend, and you know that it is being passed
to the backend, but the backend is not validating it.

1. Open the _Settings_ \\> _Authentication_ on your dashboard. What do you see?

**Answer: I see**
**`This deployment has no configured authentication providers`**:


   - Cause: You do not have an `auth.config.ts` (or `auth.config.js`) file in
     your `convex` directory, or you haven't pushed your code. Follow the
     authentication guide to create a valid auth config file. For dev
     deployments make sure you have `npx convex dev` running. For prod
     deployments make sure you successfully pushed via `npx convex deploy`.

\\*\\*Answer: I see one or more _Domain_ and _Application ID_ pairs.

Great, let's check they match the JWT token.

2. Look at the `iss` field in the JWT token payload at [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/). Does it
match a _Domain_ on the _Authentication_ page?

**Answer: No, I don't see the `iss` URL on the Convex dashboard**:


   - Potential cause: You copied the wrong value into your
      `auth.config.ts`
     's `domain`, or into the environment variable that is used there. Go back
     to the authentication guide and make sure you have the right URL from your
     auth provider.

   - Potential cause: Your client is misconfigured:
     - Clerk: You have the wrong `publishableKey` configured. The key must
       belong to the Clerk instance that you used to configure your

       `auth.config.ts`.
       - Also make sure that the JWT token in Clerk is called `convex`, as
         that's the name `ConvexProviderWithClerk` uses to fetch the token!
     - Auth0: You have the wrong `domain` configured (on the client!). The
       domain must belong to the Auth0 instance that you used to configure your
       `auth.config.ts`.

     - Custom: Make sure that your client is correctly configured to match your
       `auth.config.ts`.

**Answer: Yes, I do see the `iss` URL**:

Great, let's move one.

3. Look at the `aud` field in the JWT token payload at [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/). Does it
match the _Application ID_ under the correct _Domain_ on the _Authentication_
page?

**Answer: No, I don't see the `aud` value in the _Application ID_ field**:


   - Potential cause: You copied the wrong value into your `auth.config.ts`'s `applicationID`, or into the environment variable that is used there. Go
     back to the authentication guide and make sure you have the right value
     from your auth provider.
   - Potential cause: Your client is misconfigured:
     - Clerk: You have the wrong `publishableKey` configured.The key must belong
       to the Clerk instance that you used to configure your
       `auth.config.ts`.
     - Auth0: You have the wrong `clientId` configured. Make sure you're using
       the right `clientId` for the Auth0 instance that you used to configure
       your `auth.config.ts`.
     - Custom: Make sure that your client is correctly configured to match your
       `auth.config.ts`.

**Answer: Yes, I do see the `aud` value in the _Application ID_ field**:

Great, repeat
[step 1](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug#step-1-check-whether-authentication-works-on-the-backend) and you
should be all set!

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/vercel#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

Hosting your Convex app on Vercel allows you to automatically re-deploy both
your backend and your frontend whenever you push your code.

## Deploying to Vercel [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/vercel\\#deploying-to-vercel \"Direct link to Deploying to Vercel\")

This guide assumes you already have a working React app with Convex. If not
follow the [Convex React Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/react) first. Then:

1. Create a Vercel account



If you haven't done so, create a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account. This is
free for small projects and should take less than a minute to set up.

2. Link your project on Vercel



Create a Vercel project at [https://vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and link it to the
source code repository for your project on GitHub or other Git platform.







![Vercel import project](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/vercel_import-ea7ec18cd8c5e5575158bcf032698bc7.png)

3. Override the Build command



Override the \"Build command\" to be
`npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'`.



If your project lives in a subdirectory of your repository you'll
also need to change _Root Directory_ above accordingly.







![Vercel build settings](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/vercel_build_command-236a66a2e7e2091d610883c56954dcb9.png)

4. Set up the CONVEX\\_DEPLOY\\_KEY environment variable



On your [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/)
go to your project's _Settings_ page. Click the _Generate Production Deploy Key_ button to generate a **Production** deploy key.
Then click the copy button to copy the key.



In Vercel, click _Environment Variables_.
Create an environment variable named `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` and paste
in your deploy key. Under _Environment_, uncheck all except _Production_ and click _Save_.







![Vercel environment variable CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/vercel_prod_deploy_key-df730e5f65427ae68f68b48af225995b.png)

5. Deploy your site



Now click the _Deploy_ button and your work here is done!


Vercel will automatically publish your site to an URL like
`https://<site-name>.vercel.app`, shown on the page after deploying. Every time
you push to your Git repository, Vercel will automatically deploy your Convex
functions and publish your site changes.

Using a Custom Domain?

If you're using a custom domain to serve your Convex functions, you'll need
additional configuration. See [Custom\\\\
Domains](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/custom#hosting-with-a-custom-domain) for
more information.

### How it works [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/vercel\\#how-it-works \"Direct link to How it works\")

In Vercel, we overrode the _Build Command_ to be
`npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'`.

`npx convex deploy` will read `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` from the environment and use
it to set the `CONVEX_URL` (or similarly named) environment variable to point to
your **production** deployment.

Your frontend framework of choice invoked by `npm run build` will read the
`CONVEX_URL` (or similarly named) environment variable to point your deployed
site (via `ConvexReactClient`) at your **production** deployment.

Finally, `npx convex deploy` will push your Convex functions to your production
deployment.

Now, your production deployment has your newest functions and your app is
configured to connect to it.

You can use `--cmd-url-env-var-name` to customize the variable name used by your
frontend code if the `deploy` command cannot infer it, like

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy --cmd-url-env-var-name CUSTOM_CONVEX_URL --cmd 'npm run build'

```

### Authentication [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/vercel\\#authentication \"Direct link to Authentication\")

You will want to configure your [authentication](https://docs.convex.dev/auth) provider
(Clerk, Auth0 or other) to accept your production URL. Note that Clerk does not
support `https://<site-name>.vercel.app`, so you'll have to configure a custom
domain.

## Preview Deployments [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/vercel\\#preview-deployments \"Direct link to Preview Deployments\")

Vercel Preview Deployments allow you to preview changes to your app before
they're merged in. In order to preview both changes to frontend code and Convex
functions, you can set up
[Convex preview deployments](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/preview-deployments).

This will create a fresh Convex backend for each preview and leave your
production and development deployments unaffected.

This assumes you have already followed the steps in
[Deploying to Vercel](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/vercel#deploying-to-vercel) above.

1. Set up the CONVEX\\_DEPLOY\\_KEY environment variable



On your [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/)
go to your project's _Settings_ page. Click the _Generate Preview Deploy Key_ button to generate a **Preview** deploy key.
Then click the copy button to copy the key.



In Vercel, click _Environment Variables_.
Create an environment variable named `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` and paste
in your deploy key. Under _Environment_, uncheck all except _Preview_ and click _Save_.









![Vercel environment variable CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/vercel_preview_deploy_key-bb1badeb35323ef9c06516982aa5c8c7.png)

2. (optional) Set up default environment variables



If your app depends on certain Convex environment variables, you can set up [default\\\\
environment variables](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables#project-environment-variable-defaults) for preview and development deployments in your project.









![Project Default Environment Variables](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/project_default_environment_variables-94be77c692d0a3c9564cb7f642b6cb64.png)

3. (optional) Run a function to set up initial data



Vercel Preview Deployments run against fresh Convex backends, which do not share data
with development or production Convex deployments. You can call a Convex
function to set up data by adding `--preview-run 'functionName'` to the `npx   convex deploy` command. This function will only be run for preview deployments, and will be ignored
when deploying to production.









Vercel > Settings > Build & Development settings > Build Command





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build' --preview-run 'functionName'

```

4. Now test out creating a PR and generating a Preview Deployment!



You can find the Convex deployment for your branch in the Convex dashboard.

### How it works [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/vercel\\#how-it-works-1 \"Direct link to How it works\")

For Preview Deployments, `npx convex deploy` will read `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` from
the environment, and use it to create a Convex deployment associated with the
Git branch name for the Vercel Preview Deployment. It will set the `CONVEX_URL`
(or similarly named) environment variable to point to the new Convex deployment.

Your frontend framework of choice invoked by `npm run build` will read the
`CONVEX_URL` environment variable and point your deployed site (via
`ConvexReactClient`) at the Convex preview deployment.

Finally, `npx convex deploy` will push your Convex functions to the preview
deployment and run the `--preview-run` function (if provided). This deployment
has separate functions, data, crons and all other configuration from any other
deployments.

`npx convex deploy` will infer the Git branch name for Vercel, Netlify, GitHub,
and GitLab environments, but the `--preview-create` option can be used to
customize the name associated with the newly created deployment.

Production deployments will work exactly the same as before.

Functions run on the backend and are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript). They
are automatically available as APIs accessed through
[client libraries](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react). Everything you do in the Convex
backend starts from functions.

There are three types of functions:

- [Queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) read data from your Convex
database and are automatically cached and subscribable (realtime, reactive).
- [Mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) write data to the database and
run as a transaction.
- [Actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions) can call OpenAI, Stripe, Twilio, or any
other service or API you need to make your app work.

You can also build [HTTP actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions) when you
want to call your functions from a webhook or a custom client.

Here's an overview of the three different types of Convex functions and what
they can do:

|  | Queries | Mutations | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Database access | Yes | Yes | No |
| Transactional | Yes | Yes | No |
| Cached | Yes | No | No |
| Real-time Updates | Yes | No | No |
| External API Calls (fetch) | No | No | Yes |



[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/api#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

This code is generated

These exports are not directly available in the `convex` package!

Instead you need to run `npx convex dev` to create `convex/_generated/api.js`
and `convex/_generated/api.d.ts`.

These types require running code generation because they are specific to the
Convex functions you define for your app.

If you aren't using code generation, you can use
[`makeFunctionReference`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server#makefunctionreference) instead.

### api [​](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/api\\#api \"Direct link to api\")

An object of type `API` describing your app's public Convex API.

Its `API` type includes information about the arguments and return types of your
app's Convex functions.

The api object is used by client-side React hooks and Convex functions that run
or schedule other functions.

src/App.jsx

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";
import { useQuery } from \"convex/react\";

const data = useQuery(api.messages.list);

```

### internal [​](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/api\\#internal \"Direct link to internal\")

Another object of type `API` describing your app's internal Convex API.

convex/upgrade.js

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { action } from \"../_generated/server\";
import { internal } from \"../_generated/api\";

export default action(async ({ runMutation }, { planId, ... }) => {
  // Call out to payment provider (e.g. Stripe) to charge customer
  const response = await fetch(...);
  if (response.ok) {
    // Mark the plan as \"professional\" in the Convex DB
    await runMutation(internal.plans.markPlanAsProfessional, { planId });
  }
});

```

To use Convex in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) use the
[Convex React client library](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react).

Follow the [React Native Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/react-native) for the
different configuration needed specifically for React Native.

## Testing in GitHub Actions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/ci\\#testing-in-github-actions \"Direct link to Testing in GitHub Actions\")

It's easy if you're using [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to set up
[CI](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration)
workflow for running your test suite:

.github/workflows/test.yml

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
name: Run Tests

on: [pull_request, push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test

```

After you commit and push this file to your repository, GitHub will run
`npm run test` every time you create a pull request or push a new commit.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

Argument and return value validators ensure that
[queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions), [mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions), and
[actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions) are called with the correct types of arguments and
return the expected types of return values.

**This is important for security!** Without argument validation, a malicious
user can call your public functions with unexpected arguments and cause
surprising results. [TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/typescript) alone
won't help because TypeScript types aren't present at runtime. We recommend
adding argument validation for all public functions in production apps. For
non-public functions that are not called by clients, we recommend
[internal functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/internal-functions) and optionally
validation.

**Example:** [Argument Validation](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/args-validation)

## Adding validators [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation\\#adding-validators \"Direct link to Adding validators\")

To add argument validation to your functions, pass an object with `args` and
`handler` properties to the `query`, `mutation` or `action` constructor. To add
return value validation, use the `returns` property in this object:

convex/message.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation, query } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const send = mutation({
  args: {
    body: v.string(),
    author: v.string(),
  },
  returns: v.null(),
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const { body, author } = args;
    await ctx.db.insert(\"messages\", { body, author });
  },
});

```

If you define your function with an argument validator, there is no need to
include [TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/typescript) type
annotations! The type of your function will be inferred automatically.
Similarly, if you define a return value validator, the return type of your
function will be inferred from the validator, and TypeScript will check that it
matches the inferred return type of the `handler` function.

Unlike TypeScript, validation for an object will throw if the object contains
properties that are not declared in the validator.

If the client supplies arguments not declared in `args`, or if the function
returns a value that does not match the validator declared in `returns`. This is
helpful to prevent bugs caused by mistyped names of arguments or returning more
data than intended to a client.

Even `args: {}` is a helpful use of validators because TypeScript will show an
error on the client if you try to pass any arguments to the function which
doesn't expect them.

## Supported types [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation\\#supported-types \"Direct link to Supported types\")

All functions, both public and internal, can accept and return the following
data types. Each type has a corresponding validator that can be accessed on the
[`v`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/values#v) object imported from `\"convex/values\"`.

The [database](https://docs.convex.dev/database) can store the exact same set of
[data types](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types).

Additionally you can also express type unions, literals, `any` types, and
optional fields.

### Convex values [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation\\#convex-values \"Direct link to Convex values\")

Convex supports the following types of values:

| Convex Type | TS/JS Type | Example Usage | Validator for [Argument Validation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation) and [Schemas](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) | `json` Format for [Export](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Id | [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) | `doc._id` | `v.id(tableName)` | string | See [Document IDs](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids). |
| Null | [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#null_type) | `null` | `v.null()` | null | JavaScript's `undefined` is not a valid Convex value. Functions the return `undefined` or do not return will return `null` when called from a client. Use `null` instead. |
| Int64 | [bigint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#bigint_type) | `3n` | `v.int64()` | string (base10) | Int64s only support BigInts between -2^63 and 2^63-1. Convex supports `bigint` s in [most modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/bigint). |
| Float64 | [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type) | `3.1` | `v.number()` | number / string | Convex supports all IEEE-754 double-precision floating point numbers (such as NaNs). Inf and NaN are JSON serialized as strings. |
| Boolean | [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#boolean_type) | `true` | `v.boolean()` | bool |  |
| String | [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) | `\"abc\"` | `v.string()` | string | Strings are stored as UTF-8 and must be valid Unicode sequences. Strings must be smaller than the 1MB total size limit when encoded as UTF-8. |
| Bytes | [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) | `new ArrayBuffer(8)` | `v.bytes()` | string (base64) | Convex supports first class bytestrings, passed in as `ArrayBuffer` s. Bytestrings must be smaller than the 1MB total size limit for Convex types. |
| Array | [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) | `[1, 3.2, \"abc\"]` | `v.array(values)` | array | Arrays can have at most 8192 values. |
| Object | [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#objects) | `{a: \"abc\"}` | `v.object({property: value})` | object | Convex only supports \"plain old JavaScript objects\" (objects that do not have a custom prototype). Convex includes all [enumerable properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties). Objects can have at most 1024 entries. Field names must be nonempty and not start with \"$\" or \"\\_\". |
| Record | [Record](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type) | `{\"a\": \"1\", \"b\": \"2\"}` | `v.record(keys, values)` | object | Records are objects at runtime, but can have dynamic keys. Keys must be only ASCII characters, nonempty, and not start with \"$\" or \"\\_\". |

### Unions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation\\#unions \"Direct link to Unions\")

You can describe fields that could be one of multiple types using `v.union`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export default mutation({
  args: {
    stringOrNumber: v.union(v.string(), v.number()),
  },
  handler: async ({ db }, { stringOrNumber }) => {
    //...
  },
});

```

### Literals [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation\\#literals \"Direct link to Literals\")

Fields that are a constant can be expressed with `v.literal`. This is especially
useful when combined with unions:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export default mutation({
  args: {
    oneTwoOrThree: v.union(
      v.literal(\"one\"),
      v.literal(\"two\"),
      v.literal(\"three\"),
    ),
  },
  handler: async ({ db }, { oneTwoOrThree }) => {
    //...
  },
});

```

### Record objects [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation\\#record-objects \"Direct link to Record objects\")

You can describe objects that map arbitrary keys to values with `v.record`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export default mutation({
  args: {
    simpleMapping: v.record(v.string(), v.boolean()),
  },
  handler: async ({ db }, { simpleMapping }) => {
    //...
  },
});

```

You can use other types of string validators for the keys:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
defineTable({
  userIdToValue: v.record(v.id(\"users\"), v.boolean()),
});

```

Notes:

- This type corresponds to the
[Record<K,V>](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type)
type in TypeScript
- You cannot use string literals as a `record` key
- Using `v.string()` as a `record` key validator will only allow ASCII
characters

### Any [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation\\#any \"Direct link to Any\")

Fields that could take on any value can be represented with `v.any()`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export default mutation({
  args: {
    anyValue: v.any(),
  },
  handler: async ({ db }, { anyValue }) => {
    //...
  },
});

```

This corresponds to the `any` type in TypeScript.

### Optional fields [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation\\#optional-fields \"Direct link to Optional fields\")

You can describe optional fields by wrapping their type with `v.optional(...)`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export default mutation({
  args: {
    optionalString: v.optional(v.string()),
    optionalNumber: v.optional(v.number()),
  },
  handler: async ({ db }, { optionalString, optionalNumber }) => {
    //...
  },
});

```

This corresponds to marking fields as optional with `?` in TypeScript.

## Extracting TypeScript types [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation\\#extracting-typescript-types \"Direct link to Extracting TypeScript types\")

The [`Infer`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/values#infer) type allows you to turn validator calls
into TypeScript types. This can be useful to remove duplication between your
validators and TypeScript types:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { Infer, v } from \"convex/values\";

const nestedObject = v.object({
  property: v.string(),
});

// Resolves to `{property: string}`.
export type NestedObject = Infer<typeof nestedObject>;

export default mutation({
  args: {
    nested: nestedObject,
  },
  handler: async ({ db }, { nested }) => {
    //...
  },
});

```

Convex allows you to schedule functions to run in the future. This allows you to
build powerful durable workflows without the need to set up and maintain queues
or other infrastructure.

Scheduled functions are stored in the database. This means you can schedule
functions minutes, days, and even months in the future. Scheduling is resilient
against unexpected downtime or system restarts.

**Example:** [Scheduling](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/scheduling)

## Scheduling functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions\\#scheduling-functions \"Direct link to Scheduling functions\")

You can schedule public functions and
[internal functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/internal-functions) from mutations and
actions via the [scheduler](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Scheduler) provided in the
respective function context.

- [runAfter](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Scheduler#runafter) schedules a function to
run after a delay (measured in milliseconds).
- [runAt](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Scheduler#runat) schedules a function run at a
date or timestamp (measured in milliseconds elapsed since the epoch).

The rest of the arguments are the path to the function and its arguments,
similar to invoking a function from the client. For example, here is how to send
a message that self-destructs in five seconds.

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation, internalMutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { internal } from \"./_generated/api\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const sendExpiringMessage = mutation({
  args: { body: v.string(), author: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const { body, author } = args;
    const id = await ctx.db.insert(\"messages\", { body, author });
    await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(5000, internal.messages.destruct, {
      messageId: id,
    });
  },
});

export const destruct = internalMutation({
  args: {
    messageId: v.id(\"messages\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    await ctx.db.delete(args.messageId);
  },
});

```

A single function can schedule up to 1000 functions with total argument size of
8MB.

### Scheduling from mutations [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions\\#scheduling-from-mutations \"Direct link to Scheduling from mutations\")

Scheduling functions from
[mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions#transactions) is atomic with
the rest of the mutation. This means that if the mutation succeeds, the
scheduled function is guaranteed to be scheduled. On the other hand, if the
mutations fails, no function will be scheduled, even if the function fails after
the scheduling call.

### Scheduling from actions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions\\#scheduling-from-actions \"Direct link to Scheduling from actions\")

Unlike mutations, [actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions) don't execute as a
single database transaction and can have side effects. Thus, scheduling from
actions does not depend on the outcome of the function. This means that an
action might succeed to schedule some functions and later fail due to transient
error or a timeout. The scheduled functions will still be executed.

### Scheduling immediately [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions\\#scheduling-immediately \"Direct link to Scheduling immediately\")

Using `runAfter()` with delay set to 0 is used to immediately add a function to
the event queue. This usage may be familiar to you if you're used to calling
`setTimeout(fn, 0)`.

As noted above, actions are not atomic and are meant to cause side effects.
Scheduling immediately becomes useful when you specifically want to trigger an
action from a mutation that is conditional on the mutation succeeding.
[This post](https://stack.convex.dev/pinecone-and-embeddings#kick-off-a-background-action)
goes over a direct example of this in action, where the application depends on
an external service to fill in information to the database.

## Retrieving scheduled function status [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions\\#retrieving-scheduled-function-status \"Direct link to Retrieving scheduled function status\")

Every scheduled function is reflected as a document in the
`\"_scheduled_functions\"` system table. `runAfter()` and `runAt()` return the id
of scheduled function. You can read data from system tables using the
`db.system.get` and `db.system.query` methods, which work the same as the
standard `db.get` and `db.query` methods.

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const listScheduledMessages = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db.system.query(\"_scheduled_functions\").collect();
  },
});

export const getScheduledMessage = query({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"_scheduled_functions\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db.system.get(args.id);
  },
});

```

This is an example of the returned document:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{
  \"_creationTime\": 1699931054642.111,
  \"_id\": \"3ep33196167235462543626ss0scq09aj4gqn9kdxrdr\",
  \"args\": [{}],
  \"completedTime\": 1699931054690.366,
  \"name\": \"messages.js:destruct\",
  \"scheduledTime\": 1699931054657,
  \"state\": { \"kind\": \"success\" }
}

```

The returned document has the following fields:

- `name`: the path of the scheduled function
- `args`: the arguments passed to the scheduled function
- `scheduledTime`: the timestamp of when the function is scheduled to run
(measured in milliseconds elapsed since the epoch)
- `completedTime`: the timestamp of when the function finished running, if it
has completed (measured in milliseconds elapsed since the epoch)
- `state`: the status of the scheduled function. Here are the possible states a
scheduled function can be in:
  - `Pending`: the function has not been started yet
  - `InProgress`: the function has started running is not completed yet (only
    applies to actions)
  - `Success`: the function finished running successfully with no errors
  - `Failed`: the function hit an error while running, which can either be a
    user error or an internal server error
  - `Canceled`: the function was canceled via the dashboard,
    `ctx.scheduler.cancel`, or recursively by a parent scheduled function that
    was canceled while in progress

Scheduled function results are available for 7 days after they have completed.

## Canceling scheduled functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions\\#canceling-scheduled-functions \"Direct link to Canceling scheduled functions\")

You can cancel a previously scheduled function with
[`cancel`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Scheduler#cancel) via the
[scheduler](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Scheduler) provided in the respective
function context.

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const cancelMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"_scheduled_functions\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    await ctx.scheduler.cancel(args.id);
  },
});

```

What `cancel` does depends on the state of the scheduled function:

- If it hasn't started running, it won't run.
- If it already started, it will continue to run, but any functions it schedules
will not run.

## Debugging [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions\\#debugging \"Direct link to Debugging\")

You can view logs from previously executed scheduled functions in the Convex
dashboard [Logs view](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard#logs-view). You can view and cancel yet
to be executed functions in the
[Functions view](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard#functions-view).

## Error handling [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions\\#error-handling \"Direct link to Error handling\")

Once scheduled, mutations are guaranteed to be executed exactly once. Convex
will automatically retry any internal Convex errors, and only fail on developer
errors. See [Error Handling](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/)
for more details on different error types.

Since actions may have side effects, they are not automatically retried by
Convex. Thus, actions will be executed at most once, and permanently fail if
there are transient errors while executing them. Developers can retry those
manually by scheduling a mutation that checks if the desired outcome has been
achieved and if not schedule the action again.

## Auth [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions\\#auth \"Direct link to Auth\")

The auth is not propagated from the scheduling to the scheduled function. If you
want to authenticate or check authorization, you'll have to pass the requisite
user information in as a parameter.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

Full text search allows you to find Convex documents that approximately match a
search query.

Unlike normal
[document queries](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/#querying-documents),
search queries look _within_ a string field to find the keywords. Search queries
are useful for building features like searching for messages that contain
certain words.

Search queries are automatically reactive, consistent, transactional, and work
seamlessly with pagination. They even include new documents created with a
mutation!

**Example:** [Search App](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/search)

To use full text search you need to:

1. Define a search index.
2. Run a search query.

Search indexes are built and queried using Convex's multi-segment search
algorithm on top of [Tantivy](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/tantivy), a
powerful, open-source, full-text search library written in Rust.

Search is in beta

Searchis currently a [beta\\\\
feature](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/#beta-features). If you have feedback or feature
requests, [let us know on Discord](https://convex.dev/community)!

## Defining search indexes [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search\\#defining-search-indexes \"Direct link to Defining search indexes\")

Like [database indexes](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/), search
indexes are a data structure that is built in advance to enable efficient
querying. Search indexes are defined as part of your Convex
[schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas).

Every search index definition consists of:

1. A name.
   - Must be unique per table.
2. A `searchField`
   - This is the field which will be indexed for full text search.
   - It must be of type `string`.
3. \\[Optional\\] A list of `filterField` s
   - These are additional fields that are indexed for fast equality filtering
     within your search index.

To add a search index onto a table, use the
[`searchIndex`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/server.TableDefinition#searchindex) method on your
table's schema. For example, if you want an index which can search for messages
matching a keyword in a channel, your schema could look like:

convex/schema.ts

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from \"convex/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export default defineSchema({
  messages: defineTable({
    body: v.string(),
    channel: v.string(),
  }).searchIndex(\"search_body\", {
    searchField: \"body\",
    filterFields: [\"channel\"],
  }),
});

```

You can specify search and filter fields on nested documents by using a
dot-separated path like `properties.name`.

## Running search queries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search\\#running-search-queries \"Direct link to Running search queries\")

A query for \"10 messages in channel '#general' that best match the query 'hello
hi' in their body\" would look like:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const messages = await ctx.db
  .query(\"messages\")
  .withSearchIndex(\"search_body\", (q) =>
    q.search(\"body\", \"hello hi\").eq(\"channel\", \"#general\"),
  )
  .take(10);

```

This is just a normal
[database read](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/) that begins by
querying the search index!

The
[`.withSearchIndex`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.QueryInitializer#withsearchindex)
method defines which search index to query and how Convex will use that search
index to select documents. The first argument is the name of the index and the
second is a _search filter expression_. A search filter expression is a
description of which documents Convex should consider when running the query.

A search filter expression is always a chained list of:

1. 1 search expression against the index's search field defined with
[`.search`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.SearchFilterBuilder#search).
2. 0 or more equality expressions against the index's filter fields defined with
[`.eq`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.SearchFilterFinalizer#eq).

### Search expressions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search\\#search-expressions \"Direct link to Search expressions\")

Search expressions are issued against a search index, filtering and ranking
documents by their relevance to the search expression's query. Internally,
Convex will break up the query into separate words (called _terms_) and
approximately rank documents matching these terms.

In the example above, the expression `search(\"body\", \"hello hi\")` would
internally be split into `\"hi\"` and `\"hello\"` and matched against words in your
document (ignoring case and punctuation).

The behavior of search incorporates [prefix matching rules](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search#search-behavior).

### Equality expressions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search\\#equality-expressions \"Direct link to Equality expressions\")

Unlike search expressions, equality expressions will filter to only documents
that have an exact match in the given field. In the example above,
`eq(\"channel\", \"#general\")` will only match documents that have exactly
`\"#general\"` in their `channel` field.

Equality expressions support fields of any type (not just text).

To filter to documents that are missing a field, use
`q.eq(\"fieldName\", undefined)`.

### Other filtering [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search\\#other-filtering \"Direct link to Other filtering\")

Because search queries are normal database queries, you can also
[filter results](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/#filtering) using
the [`.filter` method](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Query#filter)!

Here's a query for \"messages containing 'hi' sent in the last 10 minutes\":

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const messages = await ctx.db
  .query(\"messages\")
  .withSearchIndex(\"search_body\", (q) => q.search(\"body\", \"hi\"))
  .filter((q) => q.gt(q.field(\"_creationTime\", Date.now() - 10 * 60000)))
  .take(10);

```

**For performance, always put as many of your filters as possible into**
**`.withSearchIndex`.**

Every search query is executed by:

1. First, querying the search index using the search filter expression in
`withSearchIndex`.
2. Then, filtering the results one-by-one using any additional `filter`
expressions.

Having a very specific search filter expression will make your query faster and
less likely to hit Convex's limits because Convex will use the search index to
efficiently cut down on the number of results to consider.

### Retrieving results and paginating [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search\\#retrieving-results-and-paginating \"Direct link to Retrieving results and paginating\")

Just like ordinary database queries, you can
[retrieve the results](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/#retrieving-results)
using [`.collect()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Query#collect),
[`.take(n)`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Query#take),
[`.first()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Query#first), and
[`.unique()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Query#unique).

Additionally, search results can be [paginated](https://docs.convex.dev/database/pagination)
using
[`.paginate(paginationOpts)`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.OrderedQuery#paginate).

Note that `collect()` will throw an exception if it attempts to collect more
than the limit of 1024 documents. It is often better to pick a smaller limit and
use `take(n)` or paginate the results.

### Ordering [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search\\#ordering \"Direct link to Ordering\")

Search queries always return results in [relevance order](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search#relevance-order)
based on how well the document matches the search query. Different ordering of
results are not supported.

## Search Behavior [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search\\#search-behavior \"Direct link to Search Behavior\")

### Typeahead Search [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search\\#typeahead-search \"Direct link to Typeahead Search\")

Convex full-text search is designed to power as-you-type search experiences. In
your search queries, the final search term has _prefix search_ enabled, matching
any term that is a prefix of the original term. For example, the expression
`search(\"body\", \"r\")` would match the documents:

- `\"rabbit\"`
- `\"send request\"`

Fuzzy search matches are deprecated. After January 15, 2025, search results will
not include `\"snake\"` for a typo like `\"stake\"`.

### Relevance order [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search\\#relevance-order \"Direct link to Relevance order\")

**Relevance order is subject to change.** The relevance of search results and
the exact typo-tolerance rules Convex applies is subject to change to improve
the quality of search results.

Search queries return results in relevance order. Internally, Convex ranks the
relevance of a document based on a combination of its
[BM25 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) and several other
criteria such as the number of typos of matched terms in the document, the
proximity of matches, the number of exact matches, and more. The BM25 score
takes into account:

- How many words in the search query appear in the field?
- How many times do they appear?
- How long is the text field?

If multiple documents have the same score, the newest documents are returned
first.

## Limits [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search\\#limits \"Direct link to Limits\")

Search indexes work best with English or other Latin-script languages. Text is
tokenized using Tantivy's
[`SimpleTokenizer`](https://docs.rs/tantivy/latest/tantivy/tokenizer/struct.SimpleTokenizer.html),
which splits on whitespace and punctuation. We also limit terms to 32 characters
in length and lowercase them.

Search indexes must have:

- Exactly 1 search field.
- Up to 16 filter fields.

Search indexes count against the
[limit of 32 indexes per table](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/#limits).

Search queries can have:

- Up to 16 terms (words) in the search expression.
- Up to 8 filter expressions.

Additionally, search queries can scan up to 1024 results from the search index.

The source of truth for these limits is our
[source code](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend/blob/main/crates/search/src/constants.rs).

Turns out Convex is automatically realtime! You don’t have to do anything
special if you are already using [query functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions),
[database](https://docs.convex.dev/database), and [client libraries](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/) in your app.
Convex tracks the dependencies to your query functions, including database
changes, and triggers the subscription in the client libraries.

![Convex is automatically reactive and realtime](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/realtime-3197272a21b075792f6ac922af228378.gif)

Aside from building a highly interactive app with ease, there are other benefits
to the realtime architecture of Convex:

## Automatic caching [​](https://docs.convex.dev/realtime\\#automatic-caching \"Direct link to Automatic caching\")

Convex automatically caches the result of your query functions so that future
calls just read from the cache. The cache is updated if the data ever changes.
You don't get charged for database bandwidth for cached reads.

This requires no work or bookkeeping from you.

## Consistent data across your app [​](https://docs.convex.dev/realtime\\#consistent-data-across-your-app \"Direct link to Consistent data across your app\")

Every client subscription gets updated simultaneously to the same snapshot of
the database. Your app always displays the most consistent view of your data.

This avoids bugs like increasing the number of items in the shopping cart and
not showing that an item is sold out.

# Convex JavaScript Clients

Convex applications can be accessed from Node.js or any JavaScript runtime that
implements [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) or
[`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket). The
reactive [Convex Client](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/browser.ConvexClient) allows web
applications and long-running Node.js servers to subscribe to updates on Convex
queries, while the [Convex HTTP client](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/browser.ConvexHttpClient)
is typically used for server-side rendering, migrations, administrative scripts,
and serverless functions to run queries at a single point in time.

If you're using React, see the dedicated
[`ConvexReactClient`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/browser.ConvexClient) described in
[React](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react).

## Convex Client [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript\\#convex-client \"Direct link to Convex Client\")

The [`ConvexClient`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/browser.ConvexClient) provides subscriptions
to queries in Node.js and any JavaScript environment that supports WebSockets.

script.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { ConvexClient } from \"convex/browser\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

const client = new ConvexClient(process.env.CONVEX_URL!);

// subscribe to query results
client.onUpdate(api.messages.listAll, {}, (messages) =>
  console.log(messages.map((msg) => msg.body)),
);

// execute a mutation
function hello() {
  client.mutation(api.messages.sendAnon, {
    body: `hello at ${new Date()}`,
  });
}

```

The Convex client is open source and available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-js).

See the [Script Tag Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/script-tag) to get started.

## HTTP client [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript\\#http-client \"Direct link to HTTP client\")

The [`ConvexHttpClient`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/browser.ConvexHttpClient) works in the
browser, Node.js, and any JavaScript environment with `fetch`.

See the [Node.js Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/nodejs).

script.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { ConvexHttpClient } from \"convex/browser\";
import { api } from \"./convex/_generated/api\";

const client = new ConvexHttpClient(process.env[\"CONVEX_URL\"]);

// either this
const count = await client.query(api.counter.get);
// or this
client.query(api.counter.get).then((count) => console.log(count));

```

## Using Convex without generated `convex/_generated/api.js` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript\\#using-convex-without-generated-convex_generatedapijs \"Direct link to using-convex-without-generated-convex_generatedapijs\")

If the source code for your Convex function isn't located in the same project or
in the same monorepos you can use the untyped `api` object called `anyApi`.

script.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { ConvexClient } from \"convex/browser\";
import { anyApi } from \"convex/server\";

const CONVEX_URL = \"http://happy-otter-123\";
const client = new ConvexClient(CONVEX_URL);
client.onUpdate(anyApi.messages.list, {}, (messages) =>
  console.log(messages.map((msg) => msg.body)),
);
setInterval(
  () =>
    client.mutation(anyApi.messages.send, {
      body: `hello at ${new Date()}`,
      author: \"me\",
    }),

Actions can call third party services to do things such as processing a payment
with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). They can be run in Convex's JavaScript
environment or in Node.js. They can interact with the database indirectly by
calling [queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) and
[mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions).

Actions follow the same naming rules as queries, see
[Query names](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#query-names).

## The `action` constructor [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#the-action-constructor \"Direct link to the-action-constructor\")

To declare an action in Convex you use the action constructor function. Pass it
an object with a `handler` function, which performs the action:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { action } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const doSomething = action({
  handler: () => {
    // implementation goes here

    // optionally return a value
    return \"success\";
  },
});

```

Unlike a query, an action can but does not have to return a value.

### Action arguments and responses [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#action-arguments-and-responses \"Direct link to Action arguments and responses\")

Action arguments and responses follow the same rules as
[mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions#mutation-arguments-and_responses):

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { action } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const doSomething = action({
  args: { a: v.number(), b: v.number() },
  handler: (_, args) => {
    // do something with `args.a` and `args.b`

    // optionally return a value
    return \"success\";
  },
});

```

The first argument to the handler function is reserved for the action context.

### Action context [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#action-context \"Direct link to Action context\")

The `action` constructor enables interacting with the database, and other Convex
features by passing an [ActionCtx](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericActionCtx)
object to the handler function as the first argument:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { action } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const doSomething = action({
  args: { a: v.number(), b: v.number() },
  handler: (ctx, args) => {
    // do something with `ctx`
  },
});

```

Which part of that action context is used depends on what your action needs to
do:

- To read data from the database use the `runQuery` field, and call a query that
performs the read:







convex/myFunctions.ts







TS

















```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { action, internalQuery } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { internal } from \"./_generated/api\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const doSomething = action({
    args: { a: v.number() },
    handler: async (ctx, args) => {
      const data = await ctx.runQuery(internal.myFunctions.readData, {
        a: args.a,
      });
      // do something with `data`
    },
});

export const readData = internalQuery({
    args: { a: v.number() },
    handler: async (ctx, args) => {
      // read from `ctx.db` here
    },
});

```









Here `readData` is an [internal query](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/internal-functions)
because we don't want to expose it to the client directly. Actions, mutations
and queries can be defined in the same file.

- To write data to the database use the `runMutation` field, and call a mutation
that performs the write:







convex/myFunctions.ts







TS

















```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { v } from \"convex/values\";
import { action } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { internal } from \"./_generated/api\";

export const doSomething = action({
    args: { a: v.number() },
    handler: async (ctx, args) => {
      const data = await ctx.runMutation(internal.myMutations.writeData, {
        a: args.a,
      });
      // do something else, optionally use `data`
    },
});

```









Use an [internal mutation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/internal-functions) when you
want to prevent users from calling the mutation directly.

As with queries, it's often convenient to define actions and mutations in the
same file.

- To generate upload URLs for storing files use the `storage` field. Read on
about [File Storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage).

- To check user authentication use the `auth` field. Auth is propagated
automatically when calling queries and mutations from the action. Read on
about [Authentication](https://docs.convex.dev/auth).

- To schedule functions to run in the future, use the `scheduler` field. Read on
about [Scheduled Functions](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions).

- To search a vector index, use the `vectorSearch` field. Read on about
[Vector Search](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search).


#### Dealing with circular type inference [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#dealing-with-circular-type-inference \"Direct link to Dealing with circular type inference\")

Working around the TypeScript error: some action `implicitly has type 'any' because it does not have a type annotation and is referenced directly or indirectly in its own initializer.`

When the return value of an action depends on the result of calling
`ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation`, TypeScript will complain that it cannot
infer the return type of the action. This is a minimal example of the issue:

convex/myFunctions.ts

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// TypeScript reports an error on `myAction`
export const myAction = action({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.runQuery(api.myFunctions.getSomething);
  },
});

export const getSomething = query({
  args: {},
  handler: () => {
    return null;
  },
});

```

To work around this, you should store the result of the `ctx.runQuery` or
`ctx.runMutation` call in a variable with a type annotation:

convex/myFunctions.ts

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const myAction = action({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const result: null = await ctx.runQuery(api.myFunctions.getSomething);
    return result;
  },
});

```

TypeScript will check that the type annotation matches what the called query or
mutation returns, so you don't lose any type safety.

In this trivial example the return type of the query was `null`. See the
[TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/typescript#type-annotating-server-side-helpers)
page for other types which might be helpful when annotating the result.

## Choosing the runtime (\"use node\") [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#choosing-the-runtime-use-node \"Direct link to Choosing the runtime (\\\"use node\\\")\")

Actions can run in Convex's custom JavaScript environment or in Node.js.

By default, actions run in Convex's environment. This environment supports
`fetch`, so actions that simply want to call a third-party API using `fetch` can
be run in this environment:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { action } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const doSomething = action({
  args: {},
  handler: async () => {
    const data = await fetch(\"https://api.thirdpartyservice.com\");
    // do something with data
  },
});

```

Actions running in Convex's environment are faster compared to Node.js, since
they don't require extra time to start up before running your action (cold
starts). They can also be defined in the same file as other Convex functions.
Like queries and mutations they can import NPM packages, but not all are
supported.

Actions needing unsupported NPM packages or Node.js APIs can be configured to
run in Node.js by adding the `\"use node\"` directive at the top of the file. Note
that other Convex functions cannot be defined in files with the `\"use node\";`
directive.

convex/myAction.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
\"use node\";

import { action } from \"./_generated/server\";
import SomeNpmPackage from \"some-npm-package\";

export const doSomething = action({
  args: {},
  handler: () => {
    // do something with SomeNpmPackage
  },
});

```

Learn more about the two [Convex Runtimes](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes).

## Splitting up action code via helpers [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#splitting-up-action-code-via-helpers \"Direct link to Splitting up action code via helpers\")

Just like with [queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#splitting-up-query-code-via-helpers)
and [mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions#splitting-up-query-code-via-helpers)
you can define and call helper

TypeScript

functions to split up the code in your actions or
reuse logic across multiple Convex functions.

But note that the [ActionCtx](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericActionCtx) only has
the `auth` field in common with
[QueryCtx](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server#queryctx) and
[MutationCtx](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server#mutationctx).

## Calling actions from clients [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#calling-actions-from-clients \"Direct link to Calling actions from clients\")

To call an action from [React](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react) use the
[`useAction`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#useaction) hook along with the generated
[`api`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/api) object.

src/myApp.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useAction } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function MyApp() {
  const performMyAction = useAction(api.myFunctions.doSomething);
  const handleClick = () => {
    performMyAction({ a: 1 });
  };
  // pass `handleClick` to a button
  // ...
}

```

Unlike
[mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react),
actions from a single client are parallelized. Each action will be executed as
soon as it reaches the server (even if other actions and mutations from the same
client are running). If your app relies on actions running after other actions
or mutations, make sure to only trigger the action after the relevant previous
function completes.

**Note:** In most cases calling an action directly from a client **is an**
**anti-pattern**. Instead, have the client call a
[mutation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) which captures the user
intent by writing into the database and then
[schedules](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions) an action:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { v } from \"convex/values\";
import { internal } from \"./_generated/api\";
import { internalAction, mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const mutationThatSchedulesAction = mutation({
  args: { text: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, { text }) => {
    const taskId = await ctx.db.insert(\"tasks\", { text });
    await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, internal.myFunctions.actionThatCallsAPI, {
      taskId,
      text,
    });
  },
});

export const actionThatCallsAPI = internalAction({
  args: { taskId: v.id(\"tasks\"), text: v.string() },
  handler: (_, args): void => {
    // do something with `taskId` and `text`, like call an API
    // then run another mutation to store the result
  },
});

```

This way the mutation can enforce invariants, such as preventing the user from
executing the same action twice.

## Limits [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#limits \"Direct link to Limits\")

Actions time out after 10 minutes.
[Node.js](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#nodejs-runtime) and
[Convex runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#default-convex-runtime) have 512MB
and 64MB memory limit respectively. Please
[contact us](https://docs.convex.dev/production/contact) if you have a use case that requires
configuring higher limits.

Actions can do up to 1000 concurrent operations, such as executing queries,
mutations or performing fetch requests.

For information on other limits, see [here](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#nodejs-runtime).

## Error handling [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#error-handling \"Direct link to Error handling\")

Unlike queries and mutations, actions may have side-effects and therefore can't
be automatically retried by Convex when errors occur. For example, say your
action calls Stripe to send a customer invoice. If the HTTP request fails,
Convex has no way of knowing if the invoice was already sent. Like in normal
backend code, it is the responsibility of the caller to handle errors raised by
actions and retry the action call if appropriate.

## Dangling promises [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#error-handling \"Direct link to Error handling\")

Make sure to await all promises created within an action. Async tasks still
running when the function returns might or might not complete. In addition,
since the Node.js execution environment might be reused between action calls,
dangling promises might result in errors in subsequent action invocations.

## Best practices [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#dangling-promises \"Direct link to Dangling promises\")

### `await ctx.runAction` should only be used for crossing JS runtimes [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#await-ctxrunaction-should-only-be-used-for-crossing-js-runtimes \"Direct link to await-ctxrunaction-should-only-be-used-for-crossing-js-runtimes\")

**Why?** `await ctx.runAction` incurs to overhead of another Convex server
function. It counts as an extra function call, it allocates it's own system
resources, and while you're awaiting this call the parent action call is frozen
holding all it's resources. If you pile enough of these calls on top of each
other, your app may slow down significantly.

**Fix:** The reason this api exists is to let you run code in the
[Node.js environment](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes). If you want to call an
action from another action that's in the same runtime, which is the normal case,
the best way to do this is to pull the code you want to call into a TypeScript
[helper function](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/#use-helper-functions-to-write-shared-code)
and call the helper instead.

### Avoid `await ctx.runMutation` / `await ctx.runQuery` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions\\#avoid-await-ctxrunmutation--await-ctxrunquery \"Direct link to avoid-await-ctxrunmutation--await-ctxrunquery\")

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌
const foo = await ctx.runQuery(...)
const bar = await ctx.runQuery(...)

// ✅
const fooAndBar = await ctx.runQuery(...)

```

**Why?** Multiple runQuery / runMutations execute in separate transactions and
aren’t guaranteed to be consistent with each other (e.g. foo and bar could read
the same document and return two different results), while a single runQuery /
runMutation will always be consistent. Additionally, you’re paying for multiple
function calls when you don’t have to.

**Fix:** Make a new internal query / mutation that does both things. Refactoring
the code for the two functions into helpers will make it easy to create a new
internal function that does both things while still keeping around the original
functions. Potentially try and refactor your action code to “batch” all the
database access.

Caveats: Separate runQuery / runMutation calls are valid when intentionally
trying to process more data than fits in a single transaction (e.g. running a
migration, doing a live aggregate).

On this page

This is a list of best practices and common anti-patterns around using Convex.
We recommend going through this list before broadly releasing your app to
production. You may choose to try using all of these best practices from the
start, or you may wait until you've gotten major parts of your app working
before going through and adopting the best practices here.

## Await all Promises [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#await-all-promises \"Direct link to Await all Promises\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why \"Direct link to Why?\")

Convex functions use async / await. If you don't await all your promises (e.g.
`await ctx.scheduler.runAfter`, `await ctx.db.patch`), you may run into
unexpected behavior (e.g. failing to schedule a function) or miss handling
errors.

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how \"Direct link to How?\")

We recommend the
[no-floating-promises](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-floating-promises/)
eslint rule with TypeScript.

## Avoid `.filter` on database queries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#avoid-filter-on-database-queries \"Direct link to avoid-filter-on-database-queries\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-1 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Filtering in code instead of using the `.filter` syntax has the same
performance, and is generally easier code to write. Conditions in `.withIndex`
or `.withSearchIndex` are more efficient than `.filter` or filtering in code, so
almost all uses of `.filter` should either be replaced with a `.withIndex` or
`.withSearchIndex` condition, or written as TypeScript code.

Read through the
[indexes documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/indexes-and-query-perf)
for an overview of how to define indexes and how they work.

### Examples [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#examples \"Direct link to Examples\")

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌
const tomsMessages = ctx.db
  .query(\"messages\")
  .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field(\"author\"), \"Tom\"))
  .collect();

// ✅
// Option 1: Use an index
const tomsMessages = await ctx.db
  .query(\"messages\")
  .withIndex(\"by_author\", (q) => q.eq(\"author\", \"Tom\"))
  .collect();

// Option 2: Filter in code
const allMessages = await ctx.db.query(\"messages\").collect();
const tomsMessages = allMessages.filter((m) => m.author === \"Tom\");

```

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-1 \"Direct link to How?\")

Search for `.filter` in your Convex codebase — a regex like `\\.filter\\(\\(?q`
will probably find all the ones on database queries.

Decide whether they should be replaced with a `.withIndex` condition — per
[this section](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/#only-use-collect-with-a-small-number-of-results),
if you are filtering over a large (1000+) or potentially unbounded number of
documents, you should use an index. If not using a `.withIndex` /
`.withSearchIndex` condition, consider replacing them with a filter in code for
more readability and flexibility.

See [this article](https://stack.convex.dev/complex-filters-in-convex) for more
strategies for filtering.

### Exceptions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#exceptions \"Direct link to Exceptions\")

Using `.filter` on a paginated query ( `.paginate`) has advantages over filtering
in code. The paginated query will return the number of documents requested,
including the `.filter` condition, so filtering in code afterwards can result in
a smaller page or even an empty page. Using `.withIndex` on a paginated query
will still be more efficient than a `.filter`.

## Only use `.collect` with a small number of results [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#only-use-collect-with-a-small-number-of-results \"Direct link to only-use-collect-with-a-small-number-of-results\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-2 \"Direct link to Why?\")

All results returned from `.collect` count towards database bandwidth (even ones
filtered out by `.filter`). It also means that if any document in the result
changes, the query will re-run or the mutation will hit a conflict.

If there's a chance the number of results is large (say 1000+ documents), you
should use an index to filter the results further before calling `.collect`, or
find some other way to avoid loading all the documents such as using pagination,
denormalizing data, or changing the product feature.

### Example [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example \"Direct link to Example\")

**Using an index:**

convex/movies.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- potentially unbounded
const allMovies = await ctx.db.query(\"movies\").collect();
const moviesByDirector = allMovies.filter(
  (m) => m.director === \"Steven Spielberg\",
);

// ✅ -- small number of results, so `collect` is fine
const moviesByDirector = await ctx.db
  .query(\"movies\")
  .withIndex(\"by_director\", (q) => q.eq(\"director\", \"Steven Spielberg\"))
  .collect();

```

**Using pagination:**

convex/movies.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- potentially unbounded
const watchedMovies = await ctx.db
  .query(\"watchedMovies\")
  .withIndex(\"by_user\", (q) => q.eq(\"user\", \"Tom\"))
  .collect();

// ✅ -- using pagination, showing recently watched movies first
const watchedMovies = await ctx.db
  .query(\"watchedMovies\")
  .withIndex(\"by_user\", (q) => q.eq(\"user\", \"Tom\"))
  .order(\"desc\")
  .paginate(paginationOptions);

```

**Using a limit or denormalizing:**

convex/movies.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- potentially unbounded
const watchedMovies = await ctx.db
  .query(\"watchedMovies\")
  .withIndex(\"by_user\", (q) => q.eq(\"user\", \"Tom\"))
  .collect();
const numberOfWatchedMovies = watchedMovies.length;

// ✅ -- Show \"99+\" instead of needing to load all documents
const watchedMovies = await ctx.db
  .query(\"watchedMovies\")
  .withIndex(\"by_user\", (q) => q.eq(\"user\", \"Tom\"))
  .take(100);
const numberOfWatchedMovies =
  watchedMovies.length === 100 ? \"99+\" : watchedMovies.length.toString();

// ✅ -- Denormalize the number of watched movies in a separate table
const watchedMoviesCount = await ctx.db
  .query(\"watchedMoviesCount\")
  .withIndex(\"by_user\", (q) => q.eq(\"user\", \"Tom\"))
  .unique();

```

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-2 \"Direct link to How?\")

Search for `.collect` in your Convex codebase (a regex like `\\.collect\\(` will
probably find these). And think through whether the number of results is small.
This function health page in the dashboard can also help surface these.

The [aggregate component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@convex-dev/aggregate)
or [database triggers](https://stack.convex.dev/triggers) can be helpful
patterns for denormalizing data.

### Exceptions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#exceptions-1 \"Direct link to Exceptions\")

If you're doing something that requires loading a large number of documents
(e.g. performing a migration, making a summary), you may want to use an action
to load them in batches via separate queries / mutations.

## Check for redundant indexes [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#check-for-redundant-indexes \"Direct link to Check for redundant indexes\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-3 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Indexes like `by_foo` and `by_foo_and_bar` are usually redundant (you only need
`by_foo_and_bar`). Reducing the number of indexes saves on database storage and
reduces the overhead of writing to the table.

convex/teams.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌
const allTeamMembers = await ctx.db
  .query(\"teamMembers\")
  .withIndex(\"by_team\", (q) => q.eq(\"team\", teamId))
  .collect();
const currentUserId = /* get current user id from `ctx.auth` */
const currentTeamMember = await ctx.db
  .query(\"teamMembers\")
  .withIndex(\"by_team_and_user\", (q) =>
    q.eq(\"team\", teamId).eq(\"user\", currentUserId),
  )
  .unique();

// ✅
// Just don't include a condition on `user` when querying for results on `team`
const allTeamMembers = await ctx.db
  .query(\"teamMembers\")
  .withIndex(\"by_team_and_user\", (q) => q.eq(\"team\", teamId))
  .collect();
const currentUserId = /* get current user id from `ctx.auth` */
const currentTeamMember = await ctx.db
  .query(\"teamMembers\")
  .withIndex(\"by_team_and_user\", (q) =>
    q.eq(\"team\", teamId).eq(\"user\", currentUserId),
  )
  .unique();

```

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-3 \"Direct link to How?\")

Look through your indexes, either in your `schema.ts` file or in the dashboard,
and look for any indexes where one is a prefix of another.

### Exceptions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#exceptions-2 \"Direct link to Exceptions\")

`.index(\"by_foo\", [\"foo\"])` is really an index on the properties `foo` and
`_creationTime`, while `.index(\"by_foo_and_bar\", [\"foo\", \"bar\"])` is an index on
the properties `foo`, `bar`, and `_creationTime`. If you have queries that need
to be sorted by `foo` and then `_creationTime`, then you need both indexes.

For example, `.index(\"by_channel\", [\"channel\"])` on a table of messages can be
used to query for the most recent messages in a channel, but
`.index(\"by_channel_and_author\", [\"channel\", \"author\"])` could not be used for
this since it would first sort the messages by `author`.

## Use argument validators for all public functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#use-argument-validators-for-all-public-functions \"Direct link to Use argument validators for all public functions\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-4 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Public functions can be called by anyone, including potentially malicious
attackers trying to break your app.
[Argument validators](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation) (as well as return value
validators) help ensure you're getting the traffic you expect.

### Example [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example-1 \"Direct link to Example\")

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- could be used to update any document (not just `messages`)
export const updateMessage = mutation({
  handler: async (ctx, { id, update }) => {
    await ctx.db.patch(id, update);
  },
});

// ✅ -- can only be called with an ID from the messages table, and can only update
// the `body` and `author` fields
export const updateMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"messages\"),
    update: v.object({
      body: v.optional(v.string()),
      author: v.optional(v.string()),
    }),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { id, update }) => {
    await ctx.db.patch(id, update);
  },
});

```

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-4 \"Direct link to How?\")

Search for `query`, `mutation`, and `action` in your Convex codebase, and ensure
that all of them have argument validators (and optionally return value
validators). If you have `httpAction` s, you may want to use something like `zod`
to validate that the HTTP request is the shape you expect.

## Use some form of access control for all public functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#use-some-form-of-access-control-for-all-public-functions \"Direct link to Use some form of access control for all public functions\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-5 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Public functions can be called by anyone, including potentially malicious
attackers trying to break your app. If portions of your app should only be
accessible when the user is signed in, make sure all these Convex functions
check that `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` is set.

You may also have specific checks, like only loading messages that were sent to
or from the current user, which you'll want to apply in every relevant public
function.

Favoring more granular functions like `setTeamOwner` over `updateTeam` allows
more granular checks for which users can do what.

Access control checks should either use `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` or a
function argument that is unguessable (e.g. a UUID, or a Convex ID, provided
that this ID is never exposed to any client but the one user). In particular,
don't use a function argument which could be spoofed (e.g. email) for access
control checks.

### Example [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example-2 \"Direct link to Example\")

convex/teams.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- no checks! anyone can update any team if they get the ID
export const updateTeam = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"teams\"),
    update: v.object({
      name: v.optional(v.string()),
      owner: v.optional(v.id(\"users\")),
    }),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { id, update }) => {
    await ctx.db.patch(id, update);
  },
});

// ❌ -- checks access, but uses `email` which could be spoofed
export const updateTeam = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"teams\"),
    update: v.object({
      name: v.optional(v.string()),
      owner: v.optional(v.id(\"users\")),
    }),
    email: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { id, update, email }) => {
    const teamMembers = /* load team members */
    if (!teamMembers.some((m) => m.email === email)) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    await ctx.db.patch(id, update);
  },
});

// ✅ -- checks access, and uses `ctx.auth`, which cannot be spoofed
export const updateTeam = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"teams\"),
    update: v.object({
      name: v.optional(v.string()),
      owner: v.optional(v.id(\"users\")),
    }),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { id, update }) => {
    const user = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (user === null) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    const isTeamMember = /* check if user is a member of the team */
    if (!isTeamMember) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    await ctx.db.patch(id, update);
  },
});

// ✅ -- separate functions which have different access control
export const setTeamOwner = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"teams\"),
    owner: v.id(\"users\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { id, owner }) => {
    const user = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (user === null) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    const isTeamOwner = /* check if user is the owner of the team */
    if (!isTeamOwner) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    await ctx.db.patch(id, { owner: owner });
  },
});

export const setTeamName = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"teams\"),
    name: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { id, name }) => {
    const user = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (user === null) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    const isTeamMember = /* check if user is a member of the team */
    if (!isTeamMember) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    await ctx.db.patch(id, { name: name });
  },
});

```

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-5 \"Direct link to How?\")

Search for `query`, `mutation`, `action`, and `httpAction` in your Convex
codebase, and ensure that all of them have some form of access control.
[Custom functions](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-helpers/blob/main/packages/convex-helpers/README.md#custom-functions)
like
[`authenticatedQuery`](https://stack.convex.dev/custom-functions#modifying-the-ctx-argument-to-a-server-function-for-user-auth)
can be helpful.

Some apps use Row Level Security (RLS) to check access to each document
automatically whenever it's loaded, as described in
[this article](https://stack.convex.dev/row-level-security). Alternatively, you
can check access in each Convex function instead of checking access for each
document.

Helper functions for common checks and common operations can also be useful --
e.g. `isTeamMember`, `isTeamAdmin`, `loadTeam` (which throws if the current user
does not have access to the team).

## Only schedule and `ctx.run*` internal functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#only-schedule-and-ctxrun-internal-functions \"Direct link to only-schedule-and-ctxrun-internal-functions\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-6 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Public functions can be called by anyone, including potentially malicious
attackers trying to break your app, and should be carefully audited to ensure
they can't be used maliciously. Functions that are only called within Convex can
be marked as internal, and relax these checks since Convex will ensure that
internal functions can only be called within Convex.

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-6 \"Direct link to How?\")

Search for `ctx.runQuery`, `ctx.runMutation`, and `ctx.runAction` in your Convex
codebase. Also search for `ctx.scheduler` and check the `crons.ts` file. Ensure
all of these use `internal.foo.bar` functions instead of `api.foo.bar`
functions.

If you have code you want to share between a public Convex function and an
internal Convex function, create a helper function that can be called from both.
The public function will likely have additional access control checks.

Alternatively, make sure that `api` from `_generated/api.ts` is never used in
your Convex functions directory.

### Examples [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#examples-1 \"Direct link to Examples\")

convex/teams.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- using `api`
export const sendMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    body: v.string(),
    author: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { body, author }) => {
    // add message to the database
  },
});

// crons.ts
crons.daily(
  \"send daily reminder\",
  { hourUTC: 17, minuteUTC: 30 },
  api.messages.sendMessage,
  { author: \"System\", body: \"Share your daily update!\" },
);

// ✅ Using `internal`
import { MutationCtx } from './_generated/server';
async function sendMessageHelper(
  ctx: MutationCtx,
  args: { body: string; author: string },
) {
  // add message to the database
}

export const sendMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    body: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { body }) => {
    const user = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (user === null) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    await sendMessageHelper(ctx, { body, author: user.name ?? \"Anonymous\" });
  },
});

export const sendInternalMessage = internalMutation({
  args: {
    body: v.string(),
    // don't need to worry about `author` being spoofed since this is an internal function
    author: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { body, author }) => {
    await sendMessageHelper(ctx, { body, author });
  },
});

// crons.ts
crons.daily(
  \"send daily reminder\",
  { hourUTC: 17, minuteUTC: 30 },
  internal.messages.sendInternalMessage,
  { author: \"System\", body: \"Share your daily update!\" },
);

```

## Use helper functions to write shared code [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#use-helper-functions-to-write-shared-code \"Direct link to Use helper functions to write shared code\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-7 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Most logic should be written as plain TypeScript functions, with the `query`,
`mutation`, and `action` wrapper functions being a thin wrapper around one or
more helper function.

Concretely, most of your code should live in a directory like `convex/model`,
and your public API, which is defined with `query`, `mutation`, and `action`,
should have very short functions that mostly just call into `convex/model`.

Organizing your code this way makes several of the refactors mentioned in this
list easier to do.

See the [TypeScript page](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/typescript) for
useful types.

### Example [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example-3 \"Direct link to Example\")

**❌** This example overuses `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation`, which is
discussed more in the
[Avoid sequential `ctx.runMutation` / `ctx.runQuery` from actions](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/#avoid-sequential-ctx-runmutation-ctx-runquery-from-actions)

    }
    const user = /* query ctx.db to load the user */
    const userSettings = /* load other documents related to the user */
    return { user, settings: userSettings };
  },

    const user = await ctx.runQuery(api.users.getCurrentUser);
    const conversation = await ctx.db.get(conversationId);
    if (conversation === null || !conversation.members.includes(user._id)) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    const messages = /* query ctx.db to load the messages */
    return messages;
  },
});

export const summarizeConversation = action({

## Use `runAction` only when using a different runtime [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#use-runaction-only-when-using-a-different-runtime \"Direct link to use-runaction-only-when-using-a-different-runtime\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-8 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Calling `runAction` has more overhead than calling a plain TypeScript function.
It counts as an extra function call with its own memory and CPU usage, while the
parent action is doing nothing except waiting for the result. Therefore,
`runAction` should almost always be replaced with calling a plain TypeScript
function. However, if you want to call code that requires Node.js from a
function in the Convex runtime (e.g. using a library that requires Node.js),
then you can use `runAction` to call the Node.js code.

### Example [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example-4 \"Direct link to Example\")

convex/scrape.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- using `runAction`
export const scrapeWebsite = action({
  args: {
    siteMapUrl: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { siteMapUrl }) => {
    const siteMap = await fetch(siteMapUrl);
    const pages = /* parse the site map */
    await Promise.all(
      pages.map((page) =>
        ctx.runAction(internal.scrape.scrapeSinglePage, { url: page }),
      ),
    );
  },
});

```

convex/model/scrape.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { ActionCtx } from '../_generated/server';

// ✅ -- using a plain TypeScript function
export async function scrapeSinglePage(
  ctx: ActionCtx,
  { url }: { url: string },
) {
  const page = await fetch(url);
  const text = /* parse the page */
  await ctx.runMutation(internal.scrape.addPage, { url, text });
}

```

convex/scrape.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import * as Scrape from './model/scrape';

export const scrapeWebsite = action({
  args: {
    siteMapUrl: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { siteMapUrl }) => {
    const siteMap = await fetch(siteMapUrl);
    const pages = /* parse the site map */
    await Promise.all(
      pages.map((page) => Scrape.scrapeSinglePage(ctx, { url: page })),
    );
  },
});

```

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-7 \"Direct link to How?\")

Search for `runAction` in your Convex codebase, and see if the function it calls
uses the same runtime as the parent function. If so, replace the `runAction`
with a plain TypeScript function. You may want to structure your functions so
the Node.js functions are in a separate directory so it's easier to spot these.

## Avoid sequential `ctx.runMutation` / `ctx.runQuery` calls from actions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#avoid-sequential-ctxrunmutation--ctxrunquery-calls-from-actions \"Direct link to avoid-sequential-ctxrunmutation--ctxrunquery-calls-from-actions\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-9 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Each `ctx.runMutation` or `ctx.runQuery` runs in its own transaction, which
means if they're called separately, they may not be consistent with each other.
If instead we call a single `ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation`, we're
guaranteed that the results we get are consistent.

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-8 \"Direct link to How?\")

Audit your calls to `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation` in actions. If you see
multiple in a row with no other code between them, replace them with a single
`ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation` that handles both things. Refactoring your
code to use helper functions will make this easier.

### Example: Queries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example-queries \"Direct link to Example: Queries\")

convex/teams.ts

### Exceptions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#exceptions-3 \"Direct link to Exceptions\")

If you're intentionally trying to process more data than fits in a single
transaction, like running a migration or aggregating data, then it makes sense
to have multiple sequential `ctx.runMutation` / `ctx.runQuery` calls.

Multiple `ctx.runQuery` / `ctx.runMutation` calls are often necessary because
the action does a side effect in between them. For example, reading some data,
feeding it to an external service, and then writing the result back to the
database.

## Use `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation` sparingly in queries and mutations [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#use-ctxrunquery-and-ctxrunmutation-sparingly-in-queries-and-mutations \"Direct link to use-ctxrunquery-and-ctxrunmutation-sparingly-in-queries-and-mutations\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-10 \"Direct link to Why?\")

While these queries and mutations run in the same transaction, and will give
consistent results, they have extra overhead compared to plain TypeScript
functions. Wanting a TypeScript helper function is much more common than needing
`ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation`.

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-9 \"Direct link to How?\")

Audit your calls to `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation` in queries and
mutations. Unless one of the exceptions below applies, replace them with a plain
TypeScript function.

### Exceptions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#exceptions-4 \"Direct link to Exceptions\")

- If you're using components, these require `ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation`.
- If you want partial rollback on an error, you will want `ctx.runMutation`
instead of a plain TypeScript function.

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const trySendMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    body: v.string(),
    author: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { body, author }) => {
    try {
      await ctx.runMutation(internal.messages.sendMessage, { body, author });
    } catch (e) {
      // Record the failure, but rollback any writes from `sendMessage`
      await ctx.db.insert(\"failures\", {
        kind: \"MessageFailed\",
        body,
        author,
        error: `Error: ${e}`,

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

Convex Android client library enables your Android application to interact with
your Convex backend. It allows your frontend code to:

1. Call
your [queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions), [mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) and [actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions)
2. Authenticate users using [Auth0](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0)

The library is open source and
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-mobile/tree/main/android).

Follow the [Android Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/android) to get started.

## Installation [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android\\#installation \"Direct link to Installation\")

You'll need to make the following changes to your app's `build.gradle[.kts]`
file.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
plugins {
    // ... existing plugins
    kotlin(\"plugin.serialization\") version \"1.9.0\"
}

dependencies {
    // ... existing dependencies
    implementation(\"dev.convex:android-convexmobile:0.4.1@aar\") {
        isTransitive = true
    }
    implementation(\"org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json:1.6.3\")
}

```

After that, sync Gradle to pick up those changes. Your app will now have access
to the Convex for Android library as well as Kotlin's JSON serialization which
is used to communicate between your code and the Convex backend.

## Connecting to a backend [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android\\#connecting-to-a-backend \"Direct link to Connecting to a backend\")

The `ConvexClient` is used to establish and maintain a connect between your
application and the Convex backend. First you need to create an instance of the
client by giving it your backend deployment URL:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
package com.example.convexapp

import dev.convex.android.ConvexClient

val convex = ConvexClient(\"https://<your domain here>.convex.cloud\")

```

You should create and use one instance of the `ConvexClient` for the lifetime of
your application process. It can be convenient to create a custom Android
[`Application`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application)
subclass and initialize it there:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
package com.example.convexapp

import android.app.Application
import dev.convex.android.ConvexClient

class MyApplication : Application() {
    lateinit var convex: ConvexClient

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        convex = ConvexClient(\"https://<your domain here>.convex.cloud\")
    }
}

```

Once you've done that, you can access the client from a Jetpack Compose
`@Composable` function like this:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
val convex = (application as MyApplication).convex

```

## Fetching data [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android\\#fetching-data \"Direct link to Fetching data\")

Convex for Android gives you access to the Convex
[reactor](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/reactor), which enables real-time
_subscriptions_ to query results. You subscribe to queries with the `subscribe`
method on `ConvexClient` which returns a `Flow`. The contents of the `Flow` will
change over time as the underlying data backing the query changes.

All methods on `ConvexClient` suspend, and need to be called from a
`CoroutineScope` or another `suspend` function. A simple way to consume a query
that returns a list of strings from a `@Composable` is to use a combination of
mutable state containing a list and `LaunchedEffect`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
var workouts: List<String> by remember { mutableStateOf(listOf()) }
LaunchedEffect(\"onLaunch\") {
    client.subscribe<List<String>>(\"workouts:get\").collect { result ->
        result.onSuccess { receivedWorkouts ->
            workouts = receivedWorkouts
        }
    }
}

```

Any time the data that powers the backend `\"workouts:get\"` query changes, a new
`Result<List<String>>` will be emitted into the `Flow` and the `workouts` list
will refresh with the new data. Any UI that uses `workouts` will then rebuild,
giving you a fully reactive UI.

Note: you may prefer to put the subscription logic wrapped a Repository as
described in the
[Android architecture patterns](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/data-layer).

### Query arguments [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android\\#query-arguments \"Direct link to Query arguments\")

You can pass arguments to `subscribe` and they will be supplied to the
associated backend `query` function. The arguments are typed as
`Map<String, Any?>`. The values in the map must be primitive values or other
maps and lists.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
val favoriteColors = mapOf(\"favoriteColors\" to listOf(\"blue\", \"red\"))
client.subscribe<List<String>>(\"users:list\", args = favoriteColors)

```

Assuming a backend query that accepts a `favoriteColors` argument, the value can
be received and used to perform logic in the query function.

tip

Use serializable [Kotlin Data classes](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android/data-types#custom-data-types)
to automatically convert Convex objects to Kotlin model classes.

caution

- There are important gotchas when
[sending and receiving numbers](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android/data-types#numerical-types)
between Kotlin and Convex.
- `_` is a used to signify private fields in Kotlin. If you want to use a
`_creationTime` and `_id` Convex fields directly without warnings you'll have
to
[convert the field name in Kotlin](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android/data-types#field-name-conversion).
- Depending on your backend functions, you may need to deal with
[reserved Kotlin keywords](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android/data-types#field-name-conversion).

### Subscription lifetime [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android\\#subscription-lifetime \"Direct link to Subscription lifetime\")

The `Flow` returned from `subscribe` will persist as long as something is
waiting to consume results from it. When a `@Composable` or `ViewModel` with a
subscription goes out of scope, the underlying query subscription to Convex will
be canceled.

## Editing data [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android\\#editing-data \"Direct link to Editing data\")

You can use the `mutation` method on `ConvexClient` to trigger a backend
[mutation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions).

You'll need to use it in another `suspend` function or a `CoroutineScope`.
Mutations can return a value or not. If you expect a type in the response,
indicate it in the call signature.

Mutations can also receive arguments, just like queries. Here's an example of
returning a type from a mutation with arguments:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
val recordsDeleted = convex.mutation<@ConvexNum Int>(
  \"messages:cleanup\",
  args = mapOf(\"keepLatest\" to 100)
)

```

If an error occurs during a call to `mutation`, it will throw an exception.
Typically you may want to catch
[`ConvexError`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/application-errors)
and `ServerError` and handle them however is appropriate in your application.
See documentation on
[error handling](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/) for more
details.

## Calling third-party APIs [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android\\#calling-third-party-apis \"Direct link to Calling third-party APIs\")

You can use the `action` method on `ConvexClient` to trigger a backend
[action](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions).

Calls to `action` can accept arguments, return values and throw exceptions just
like calls to `mutation`.

Even though you can call actions from Android, it's not always the right choice.
See the action docs for tips on
[calling actions from clients](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions#calling-actions-from-clients).

## Authentication with Auth0 [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android\\#authentication-with-auth0 \"Direct link to Authentication with Auth0\")

You can use `ConvexClientWithAuth` in place of `ConvexClient` to configure
authentication with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). You'll need the
`convex-android-auth0` library to do that, as well as an Auth0 account and
application configuration.

See the
[README](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-android-auth0/blob/main/README.md)
in the `convex-android-auth0` repo for more detailed setup instructions, and the
[Workout example app](https://github.com/get-convex/android-convex-workout)
which is configured for Auth0. The overall
[Convex authentication docs](https://docs.convex.dev/auth) are a good resource
as well.

It should also be possible to integrate other similar OpenID Connect
authentication providers. See the
[`AuthProvider`](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-mobile/blob/5babd583631a7ff6d739e1a2ab542039fd532548/android/convexmobile/src/main/java/dev/convex/android/ConvexClient.kt#L291)
interface in the `convex-mobile` repo for more info.

## Production and dev deployments [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android\\#production-and-dev-deployments \"Direct link to Production and dev deployments\")

When you're ready to move toward
[production](https://docs.convex.dev/production) for your app, you can setup
your Android build system to point different builds or flavors of your
application to different Convex deployments. One fairly simple way to do it is
by passing different values (e.g. deployment URL) to different build targets or
flavors.

Here's a simple example that shows using different deployment URLs for release
and debug builds:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// In the android section of build.gradle.kts:
buildTypes {
    release {
        // Snip various other config like ProGuard ...
        resValue(\"string\", \"convex_url\", \"YOUR_PROD.convex.cloud\")
    }

    debug {
        resValue(\"string\", \"convex_url\", \"YOUR_DEV.convex.cloud\")
    }
}

```

Then you can build your `ConvexClient` using a single resource in code, and it
will get the right value at compile time.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
val convex = ConvexClient(context.getString(R.string.convex_url))

```

tip

You may not want these urls checked into your repository. One pattern is to
create a custom `my_app.properties` file that is configured to be ignored in
your `.gitignore` file. You can then read this file in your `build.gradle.kts`
file. You can see this pattern in use in the
[workout sample app](https://github.com/get-convex/android-convex-workout?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).

## Structuring your application [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android\\#structuring-your-application \"Direct link to Structuring your application\")

The examples shown in this guide are intended to be brief, and don't provide
guidance on how to structure a whole application.

The official
[Android application architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/intro)
docs cover best practices for building applications, and Convex also has a
[sample open source application](https://github.com/get-convex/android-convex-workout/tree/main)
that attempts to demonstrate what a small multi-screen application might look
like.

In general, do the following:

1. Embrace Flows and
[unidirectional data flow](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/architecture#udf)
2. Have a clear
[data layer](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/data-layer)
(use Repository classes with `ConvexClient` as your data source)
3. Hold UI state in a
[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/recommendations#viewmodel)

## Testing [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android\\#testing \"Direct link to Testing\")

`ConvexClient` is an `open` class so it can be mocked or faked in unit tests. If
you want to use more of the real client, you can pass a fake
`MobileConvexClientInterface` in to the `ConvexClient` constructor. Just be
aware that you'll need to provide JSON in Convex's undocumented
[JSON format](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-mobile/blob/5babd583631a7ff6d739e1a2ab542039fd532548/android/convexmobile/src/main/java/dev/convex/android/jsonhelpers.kt#L47).

You can also use the full `ConvexClient` in Android instrumentation tests. You
can setup a special backend instance for testing or run a local Convex server
and run full integration tests.

## Under the hood [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/android\\#under-the-hood \"Direct link to Under the hood\")

Convex for Android is built on top of the official
[Convex Rust client](https://docs.convex.dev/client/rust). It handles
maintaining a WebSocket connection with the Convex backend and implements the
full Convex protocol.

All method calls on `ConvexClient` are handled via a Tokio async runtime on the
Rust side and are safe to call from the application's main thread.

`ConvexClient` also makes heavy use of
[Kotlin's serialization framework](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/blob/master/docs/serialization-guide.md),
and most of the functionality in that framework is available for you to use in
your applications. Internally, `ConvexClient` enables the JSON
[`ignoreUnknownKeys`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/blob/master/docs/json.md#ignoring-unknown-keys)
and
[`allowSpecialFloatingPointValues`](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization/blob/master/docs/json.md#allowing-special-floating-point-values)
features.

Convex supports Backup & Restore of data via the
[dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/settings/backups).

![Backups Page](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/backups-7e17da1541fc3eb26194a96ab33414ea.png)

# Backups

A backup is a consistent snapshot of your table data and file storage made at
the time of your request.

Take a backup by pressing the \"Backup Now\" button. This may take a few seconds
to a few hours, depending on how much data is in your deployment.

Backups are stored for 7 days. You can download or delete backups via this page.

Deployment configuration and other data (code, environment variables, scheduled
functions, etc.) will not be included.

### Periodic Backups [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/backup-restore\\#periodic-backups \"Direct link to Periodic Backups\")

Schedule a periodic daily backup by checking the \"Backup automatically\" box. You
can select what time of day to have the backup occur.

Periodic backups require a Convex Pro plan.

Periodic backupsrequire a Convex Pro plan. [Learn\\\\
more](https://convex.dev/pricing) about our plans or
[upgrade](https://dashboard.convex.dev/team/settings/billing).

### Restoring from backup [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/backup-restore\\#restoring-from-backup \"Direct link to Restoring from backup\")

Restore from a backup by selecting restore from the submenu of an individual.
You can restore from backups in the same deployment or from other deployments on
the same team by using the deployment selector on the backups page. Restores may
take a few seconds to a few hours depending on how much data is in your backup.

Note that restoring is a destructive operation that wipes your existing data and
replaces it with that from the backup. It's recommended that you generate an
additional backup before doing a restore.

### Restoring in an emergency [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/backup-restore\\#restoring-in-an-emergency \"Direct link to Restoring in an emergency\")

If your production deployment ends up in a bad state, you may want to consider
doing a restore to return to a good state. Note that getting your data to a good
state may not be enough. Consider whether you may need each of the following
actions. Depending on the nature of your emergency, these may be required.

- Take an additional backup prior to restore, since restores are destructive
- Do a restore from a good backup - to restore data
- Use `npx convex dev` to push a known version of good code.
- Use `npx convex env` or the dashboard to restore to a good set of env vars
- Use the dashboard to make any manual fixes to the database for your app.
- Write mutations to make required (more programmatic) manual fixes to the
database for your app.

# Downloading a backup

You can download your manual and periodic backups from the dashboard via the
download button in the menu.

Alternatively, you can generate an export in the same format with the
[command line](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#export-data-to-a-file):

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex export --path ~/Downloads

```

The backup comes as a generated a ZIP file with all documents in all Convex
tables in your deployment.

The ZIP file's name has the format `snapshot_{ts}.zip` where `ts` is a UNIX
timestamp of the snapshot in nanoseconds. The export ZIP file contains documents
for each table at `<table_name>/documents.jsonl`, with one document per line.

Exported ZIP files also contain data from [file storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage) in a
`_storage` folder, with metadata like IDs and checksums in
`_storage/documents.jsonl` and each file as `_storage/<id>`.

### Using the downloaded backup. [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/backup-restore\\#using-the-downloaded-backup \"Direct link to Using the downloaded backup.\")

Downloaded ZIP files can be imported into the same deployment or a different
deployment with the
[CLI](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/import#import-data-from-a-snapshot-zip-file).

## FAQ [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/backup-restore\\#faq \"Direct link to FAQ\")

### Are there any limitations? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/backup-restore\\#are-there-any-limitations \"Direct link to Are there any limitations?\")

Each backup is accessible for up to 7 days.

On the Starter plan, up to two backups can stored per deployment at a time. Paid
plan deployments can have many backups with standard usage based pricing.

### How are they priced? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/backup-restore\\#how-are-they-priced \"Direct link to How are they priced?\")

Backups uses database bandwidth to read all documents, and file bandwidth to
include user files. The generation and storage of the backup itself is billed
with the same bandwidth and storage pricing as user file storage. You can
observe this bandwidth and storage cost in the
[usage dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/team/settings/usage). Check the
[limits docs](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits#database) for pricing details.

### What does the backup not contain? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/backup-restore\\#what-does-the-backup-not-contain \"Direct link to What does the backup not contain?\")

The backup only contains the documents for your tables and files in file
storage. In particular it lacks:

1. Your deployment's code and configuration. Convex functions, crons.ts,
auth.config.js, schema.ts, etc. are configured in your source code.
2. Pending scheduled functions. You can access pending scheduled functions in
the [`_scheduled_functions`](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/system-tables)
system table.
3. Environment variables. Environment variables can be copied from Settings in
the Convex dashboard.

All Convex documents are defined as Javascript objects. These objects can have
field values of any of the types below.

You can codify the shape of documents within your tables by
[defining a schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas).

## Convex values [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types\\#convex-values \"Direct link to Convex values\")

Convex supports the following types of values:

| Convex Type | TS/JS Type | Example Usage | Validator for [Argument Validation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation) and [Schemas](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) | `json` Format for [Export](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Id | [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) | `doc._id` | `v.id(tableName)` | string | See [Document IDs](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids). |
| Null | [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#null_type) | `null` | `v.null()` | null | JavaScript's `undefined` is not a valid Convex value. Functions the return `undefined` or do not return will return `null` when called from a client. Use `null` instead. |
| Int64 | [bigint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#bigint_type) | `3n` | `v.int64()` | string (base10) | Int64s only support BigInts between -2^63 and 2^63-1. Convex supports `bigint` s in [most modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/bigint). |
| Float64 | [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type) | `3.1` | `v.number()` | number / string | Convex supports all IEEE-754 double-precision floating point numbers (such as NaNs). Inf and NaN are JSON serialized as strings. |
| Boolean | [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#boolean_type) | `true` | `v.boolean()` | bool |  |
| String | [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) | `\"abc\"` | `v.string()` | string | Strings are stored as UTF-8 and must be valid Unicode sequences. Strings must be smaller than the 1MB total size limit when encoded as UTF-8. |
| Bytes | [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) | `new ArrayBuffer(8)` | `v.bytes()` | string (base64) | Convex supports first class bytestrings, passed in as `ArrayBuffer` s. Bytestrings must be smaller than the 1MB total size limit for Convex types. |
| Array | [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) | `[1, 3.2, \"abc\"]` | `v.array(values)` | array | Arrays can have at most 8192 values. |
| Object | [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#objects) | `{a: \"abc\"}` | `v.object({property: value})` | object | Convex only supports \"plain old JavaScript objects\" (objects that do not have a custom prototype). Convex includes all [enumerable properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Enumerability_and_ownership_of_properties). Objects can have at most 1024 entries. Field names must be nonempty and not start with \"$\" or \"\\_\". |
| Record | [Record](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type) | `{\"a\": \"1\", \"b\": \"2\"}` | `v.record(keys, values)` | object | Records are objects at runtime, but can have dynamic keys. Keys must be only ASCII characters, nonempty, and not start with \"$\" or \"\\_\". |

## System fields [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types\\#system-fields \"Direct link to System fields\")

Every document in Convex has two automatically-generated system fields:

- `_id`: The [document ID](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids) of the document.
- `_creationTime`: The time this document was created, in milliseconds since the
Unix epoch.

## Limits [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types\\#limits \"Direct link to Limits\")

Convex values must be less than 1MB in total size. This is an approximate limit
for now, but if you're running into these limits and would like a more precise
method to calculate a document's size,
[reach out to us](https://convex.dev/community). Documents can have nested
values, either objects or arrays that contain other Convex types. Convex types
can have at most 16 levels of nesting, and the cumulative size of a nested tree
of values must be under the 1MB limit.

Table names may contain alphanumeric characters (\"a\" to \"z\", \"A\" to \"Z\", and \"0\"
to \"9\") and underscores (\"\\_\"), and they cannot start with an underscore.

For information on other limits, see [here](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits).

If any of these limits don't work for you,
[let us know](https://convex.dev/community)!

## Working with `undefined` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types\\#working-with-undefined \"Direct link to working-with-undefined\")

The TypeScript value `undefined` is not a valid Convex value, so it cannot be
used in Convex function arguments or return values, or in stored documents.

1. Objects/records with `undefined` values are the same as if the field were
missing: `{a: undefined}` is transformed into `{}` when passed to a function
or stored in the database. You can think of Convex function calls and the
Convex database as serializing the data with `JSON.stringify`, which
similarly removes `undefined` values.
2. Validators for object fields can use `v.optional(...)` to indicate that the
field might not be present.
   - If an object's field \"a\" is missing, i.e. `const obj = {};`, then
     `obj.a === undefined`. This is a property of TypeScript/JavaScript, not
     specific to Convex.
3. You can use `undefined` in filters and index queries, and it will match
documents that do not have the field. i.e.
`.withIndex(\"by_a\", q=>q.eq(\"a\", undefined))` matches document `{}` and
`{b: 1}`, but not `{a: 1}` or `{a: null, b: 1}`.
   - In Convex's ordering scheme, `undefined < null < all other values`, so you
     can match documents that _have_ a field via `q.gte(\"a\", null as any)`.
4. There is exactly one case where `{a: undefined}` is different from `{}`: when
passed to `ctx.db.patch`. Passing `{a: undefined}` removes the field \"a\" from
the document, while passing `{}` does not change the field \"a\". See
[Updating existing documents](https://docs.convex.dev/database/writing-data#updating-existing-documents).
5. Since `undefined` gets stripped from function arguments but has meaning in
`ctx.db.patch`, there are some tricks to pass patch's argument from the
client.
   - If the client passing `args={}` (or `args={a: undefined}` which is
     equivalent) should leave the field \"a\" unchanged, use
     `ctx.db.patch(id, args)`.
   - If the client passing `args={}` should remove the field \"a\", use
     `ctx.db.patch(id, {a: undefined, ...args})`.
   - If the client passing `args={}` should leave the field \"a\" unchanged and
     `args={a: null}` should remove it, you could do




     ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
     if (args.a === null) {
       args.a = undefined;
     }
     await ctx.db.patch(id, args);

     ```
6. Functions that return a plain `undefined`/ `void` are treated as if they
returned `null`.
7. Arrays containing `undefined` values, like `[undefined]`, throw an error when
used as Convex values.

If you would prefer to avoid the special behaviors of `undefined`, you can use
`null` instead, which _is_ a valid Convex value.

## Working with dates and times [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types\\#working-with-dates-and-times \"Direct link to Working with dates and times\")

Convex does not have a special data type for working with dates and times. How
you store dates depends on the needs of your application:

1. If you only care about a point in time, you can store a
[UTC timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). We recommend
following the `_creationTime` field example, which stores the timestamp as a
`number` in milliseconds. In your functions and on the client you can create
a JavaScript `Date` by passing the timestamp to its constructor:
`new Date(timeInMsSinceEpoch)`. You can then print the date and time in the
desired time zone (such as your user's machine's configured time zone).   - To get the current UTC timestamp in your function and store it in the
        database, use `Date.now()`
2. If you care about a calendar date or a specific clock time, such as when
implementing a booking app, you should store the actual date and/or time as a
string. If your app supports multiple timezones you should store the timezone
as well. [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) is a common format
for storing dates and times together in a single string like
`\"2024-03-21T14:37:15Z\"`. If your users can choose a specific time zone you
should probably store it in a separate `string` field, usually using the
[IANA time zone name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database#Names_of_time_zones)
(although you could concatenate the two fields with unique character like
`\"|\"`).

For more sophisticated printing (formatting) and manipulation of dates and times
use one of the popular JavaScript libraries: [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/),
[Day.js](https://day.js.org/), [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) or
[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).

Learn how to query data from Convex in a Python app.

1. Create a Python script folder



Create a folder for your Python script
with a virtual environment.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
python3 -m venv my-app/venv

```

2. Install the Convex client and server libraries



To get started, install the `convex` npm
package which enables you to write your
backend.



And also install the `convex` Python client
library and `python-dotenv` for working with `.env` files.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
cd my-app && npm init -y && npm install convex && venv/bin/pip install convex python-dotenv

```

3. Set up a Convex dev deployment



Next, run `npx convex dev`. This
will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.



It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
will then continue running to sync your functions
with your dev deployment in the cloud.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dev

```

4. Create sample data for your database



In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl`
file with some sample data.









sampleData.jsonl





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
{\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
{\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

```

5. Add the sample data to your database



Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table
with the sample data into your Convex database with
the `import` command.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

```

6. Expose a database query



Add a new file `tasks.js` in the `convex/` folder
with a query function that loads the data.



Exporting a query function from this file
declares an API function named after the file
and the export name, `\"tasks:get\"`.









convex/tasks.js





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const get = query({
     handler: async ({ db }) => {
       return await db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
     },
});

```

7. Create a script to load data from Convex



In a new file `main.py`, create a `ConvexClient` and use it
to fetch from your `\"tasks:get\"` API.









main.py





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

from convex import ConvexClient

load_dotenv(\".env.local\")
CONVEX_URL = os.getenv(\"CONVEX_URL\")
# or you can hardcode your deployment URL instead
# CONVEX_URL = \"https://happy-otter-123.convex.cloud\"

client = ConvexClient(CONVEX_URL)

print(client.query(\"tasks:get\"))

for tasks in client.subscribe(\"tasks:get\"):
       print(tasks)
       # this loop lasts forever, ctrl-c to exit it

```

8. Run the script



Run the script
and see the serialized list of tasks.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
venv/bin/python -m main

```


See the [docs on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/convex/) for more details.

To get setup quickly with Convex and React run

**`npm create convex@latest`**

**``**

or follow the guide below.

Learn how to query data from Convex in a React app using Vite
and

TypeScript

01. Create a React app



    Create a React app using the `create vite` command.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts

    ```

02. Install the Convex client and server library



    To get started, install the `convex`
    package which provides a convenient interface for working
    with Convex from a React app.



    Navigate to your app directory and install `convex`.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    cd my-app && npm install convex

    ```

03. Set up a Convex dev deployment



    Next, run `npx convex dev`. This
    will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
    create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.



    It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
    to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
    will then continue running to sync your functions
    with your dev deployment in the cloud.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex dev

    ```

04. Create sample data for your database



    In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl`
    file with some sample data.









    sampleData.jsonl





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    {\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

    ```

05. Add the sample data to your database



    Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table
    with the sample data into your Convex database with
    the `import` command.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

    ```

06. (optional) Define a schema



    Add a new file `schema.ts` in the `convex/` folder
    with a description of your data.



    This will declare the types of your data for optional
    typechecking with TypeScript, and it will be also
    enforced at runtime.



    Alternatively remove the line `'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-requiring-type-checking',`
    from the `.eslintrc.cjs` file to lower the type checking strictness.









    convex/schema.ts





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { defineSchema, defineTable } from \"convex/server\";
    import { v } from \"convex/values\";

    export default defineSchema({
      tasks: defineTable({
        text: v.string(),
        isCompleted: v.boolean(),
      }),
    });

    ```

07. Expose a database query



    Add a new file `tasks.ts` in the `convex/` folder
    with a query function that loads the data.



    Exporting a query function from this file
    declares an API function named after the file
    and the export name, `api.tasks.get`.













    convex/tasks.ts







    TS

















    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

    export const get = query({
      args: {},
      handler: async (ctx) => {
        return await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
      },
    });

    ```

08. Connect the app to your backend



    In `src/main.tsx`, create a `ConvexReactClient` and pass it to a `ConvexProvider`
    wrapping your app.













    src/main.tsx







    TS

















    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import React from \"react\";
    import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";
    import App from \"./App\";
    import \"./index.css\";
    import { ConvexProvider, ConvexReactClient } from \"convex/react\";

    const convex = new ConvexReactClient(import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL as string);

    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\")!).render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <ConvexProvider client={convex}>
          <App />
        </ConvexProvider>
      </React.StrictMode>,
    );

    ```

09. Display the data in your app



    In `src/App.tsx`, use the `useQuery` hook to fetch from your `api.tasks.get`
    API function and display the data.













    src/App.tsx







    TS

















    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import \"./App.css\";
    import { useQuery } from \"convex/react\";
    import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

    function App() {
      const tasks = useQuery(api.tasks.get);
      return (
        <div className=\"App\">
          {tasks?.map(({ _id, text }) => <div key={_id}>{text}</div>)}
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;



    ```

10. Start the app



    Start the app, open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in a browser,
    and see the list of tasks.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npm run dev

    ```


Using `create-react-app`? See the
[Create React App](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/quickstart-create-react-app) version of this
guide.



[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript/node#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

Convex supports point-in-time queries (see
[HTTP client](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/browser.ConvexHttpClient)) and query subscriptions
(see [ConvexClient](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/browser.ConvexClient)) in Node.js.

If your JavaScript code uses import/export syntax, calling Convex functions
works just like in a browser.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { ConvexHttpClient, ConvexClient } from \"convex/browser\";
import { api } from \"./convex/_generated/api.js\";

// HTTP client
const httpClient = new ConvexHttpClient(CONVEX_URL_GOES_HERE);
httpClient.query(api.messages.list).then(console.log);

// Subscription client
const client = new ConvexClient(CONVEX_URL_GOES_HERE);
client.onUpdate(api.messages.list, {}, (messages) => console.log(messages));

```

## TypeScript [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript/node\\#typescript \"Direct link to TypeScript\")

Just like bundling for the browser, bundling TypeScript code for Node.js with
webpack, esbuild, rollup, vite, and others usually allow you import from code
that uses import/export syntax with no extra setup.

If you use TypeScript to _compile_ your code (this is rare for web projects but
more common with Node.js), add `\"allowJs\": true` to `tsconfig.json` compiler
options so that TypeScript will compile the `api.js` file as well.

## TypeScript without a compile step [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript/node\\#typescript-without-a-compile-step \"Direct link to TypeScript without a compile step\")

If you want to run your TypeScript script directly without a compile step,
installing [ts-node-esm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) and running your
script with ts-node-esm should work if you use `\"type\": \"module\"` in your
`package.json`.

## JavaScript with CommonJS ( `require()` syntax) [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript/node\\#javascript-with-commonjs-require-syntax \"Direct link to javascript-with-commonjs-require-syntax\")

If you don't use `\"type\": \"module\"` in the `package.json` of your project you'll
need to use `require()` syntax and Node.js will not be able to import the
`convex/_generated/api.js` file directly.

In the same directory as your `package.json`, create or edit
[`convex.json`](https://docs.convex.dev/production/project-configuration#convex.json):

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{
  \"generateCommonJSApi\": true
}

```

When the `convex dev` command generates files in `convex/_generated/` a new
`api_cjs.cjs` file will be created which can be imported from CommonJS code.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const { ConvexHttpClient, ConvexClient } = require(\"convex/browser\");
const { api } = require(\"./convex/_generated/api_cjs.cjs\");
const httpClient = new ConvexHttpClient(CONVEX_URL_GOES_HERE);

```

## TypeScript with CommonJS without a compile step [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript/node\\#typescript-with-commonjs-without-a-compile-step \"Direct link to TypeScript with CommonJS without a compile step\")

Follow the steps above for CommonJS and use
[`ts-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) to run you code. Be sure your
`tsconfig.json` is configured for CommonJS output.

## Using Convex with Node.js without codegen [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript/node\\#using-convex-with-nodejs-without-codegen \"Direct link to Using Convex with Node.js without codegen\")

You can always use the `anyApi` object or strings if you don't have the Convex
functions and api file handy. An api reference like `api.folder.file.exportName`
becomes `anyApi.folder.file.exportName` or `\"folder/file:exportName\"`.

Utilities for implementing server-side Convex query and mutation functions.

## Usage [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server\\#usage \"Direct link to Usage\")

### Code Generation [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server\\#code-generation \"Direct link to Code Generation\")

This module is typically used alongside generated server code.

To generate the server code, run `npx convex dev` in your Convex project.
This will create a `convex/_generated/server.js` file with the following
functions, typed for your schema:

- [query](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server#query)
- [mutation](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server#mutation)

If you aren't using TypeScript and code generation, you can use these untyped
functions instead:

- [queryGeneric](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server#querygeneric)
- [mutationGeneric](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server#mutationgeneric)

### Example [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server\\#example \"Direct link to Example\")

Convex functions are defined by using either the `query` or
`mutation` wrappers.

Queries receive a `db` that implements the [GenericDatabaseReader](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericDatabaseReader) interface.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

export default query(async ({ db }, { arg1, arg2 }) => {
  // Your (read-only) code here!
});

```

If your function needs to write to the database, such as inserting, updating,
or deleting documents, use `mutation` instead which provides a `db` that
implements the [GenericDatabaseWriter](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericDatabaseWriter) interface.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";

export default mutation(async ({ db }, { arg1, arg2 }) => {
  // Your mutation code here!
});

```

### FunctionReference [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server\\#functionreference \"Direct link to FunctionReference\")

Ƭ **FunctionReference** < `Type`, `Visibility`, `Args`, `ReturnType`, `ComponentPath` >: `Object`

A reference to a registered Convex function.

You can create a [FunctionReference](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server#functionreference) using the generated `api` utility:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

const reference = api.myModule.myFunction;

```

If you aren't using code generation, you can create references using
[anyApi](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server#anyapi-1):

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { anyApi } from \"convex/server\";

const reference = anyApi.myModule.myFunction;

```

Function references can be used to invoke functions from the client. For
example, in React you can pass references to the [useQuery](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#usequery) hook:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const result = useQuery(api.myModule.myFunction);

```

**`Deprecated`**

\\-\\- See the type definition for `MutationBuilder` or similar for
the types used for defining Convex functions.

The definition of a Convex query, mutation, or action function without
argument validation.

Convex functions always take a context object as their first argument
and an (optional) args object as their second argument.

This can be written as a function like:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const func = query(({ db }, { arg }) => {...});

```

or as an object like:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const func = query({
  handler: ({ db }, { arg }) => {...},
});

```

See [ValidatedFunction](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.ValidatedFunction) to add argument validation.

### ReturnValueForOptionalValidator [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server\\#returnvalueforoptionalvalidator \"Direct link to ReturnValueForOptionalValidator\")

Ƭ **ReturnValueForOptionalValidator** < `ReturnsValidator` >: \\[ `ReturnsValidator`\\] extends \\[ [`Validator`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/values#validator) < `any`, `any`, `any` >\\] ? `ValidatorTypeToReturnType` < [`Infer`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/values#infer) < `ReturnsValidator` >\\> : \\[ `ReturnsValidator`\\] extends \\[ [`PropertyValidators`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/values#propertyvalidators)\\] ? `ValidatorTypeToReturnType` < [`ObjectType`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/values#objecttype) < `ReturnsValidator` >\\> : `any`

There are multiple syntaxes for defining a Convex function:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
 - query(async (ctx, args) => {...})
 - query({ handler: async (ctx, args) => {...} })
 - query({ args: { a: v.string }, handler: async (ctx, args) => {...} } })
 - query({ args: { a: v.string }, returns: v.string(), handler: async (ctx, args) => {...} } })

```

In each of these, we want to correctly infer the type for the arguments and
return value, preferring the type derived from a validator if it's provided.

To avoid having a separate overload for each, which would show up in error messages,
we use the type params -- ArgsValidator, ReturnsValidator, ReturnValue, OneOrZeroArgs.

The type for ReturnValue and OneOrZeroArgs are constrained by the type or ArgsValidator and
ReturnsValidator if they're present, and inferred from any explicit type annotations to the
arguments or return value of the function.

Below are a few utility types to get the appropriate type constraints based on
an optional validator.

Additional tricks:

- We use Validator \\| void instead of Validator \\| undefined because the latter does
not work with `strictNullChecks` since it's equivalent to just `Validator`.
- We use a tuple type of length 1 to avoid distribution over the union

### anyApi [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server\\#anyapi-1 \"Direct link to anyApi\")

• `Const` **anyApi**: [`AnyApi`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server#anyapi)

A utility for constructing [FunctionReference](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server#functionreference) s in projects that
are not using code generation.

You can create a reference to a function like:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const reference = anyApi.myModule.myFunction;

```

This supports accessing any path regardless of what directories and modules
are in your project. All function references are typed as
AnyFunctionReference.

If you're using code generation, use `api` from `convex/_generated/api`
instead. It will be more type-safe and produce better auto-complete
in your editor.

it may be useful to be able to build one manually.

Real function references are empty objects at runtime, but the same interface
can be implemented with an object for tests and clients which don't use
code generation.

▸ **createFunctionHandle** < `Type`, `Args`, `ReturnType` >( `functionReference`): `Promise` < [`FunctionHandle`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server#functionhandle) < `Type`, `Args`, `ReturnType` >>

Create a serializable reference to a Convex function.
Passing a this reference to another component allows that component to call this
function during the current function execution or at any later time.
Function handles are used like `api.folder.function` FunctionReferences,
e.g. `ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, functionReference, args)`.

A function reference is stable across code pushes but it's possible
the Convex function it refers to might no longer exist.

This is a feature of components, which are in beta.

This quickstart assumes that you have Android Studio, node and npm installed. If
you don’t have those tools, take time to install them first.

01. Create a new Android app in Android Studio



    Choose the following options in the wizard.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
1. Choose the \"Empty Activity\" template
2. Name it \"Convex Quickstart\"
3. Choose min SDK as 26
4. Choose Kotlin as the Gradle DSL

```

02. Configure the AndroidManifest



    Add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml`.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>
    <manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"
        xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\">
        <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>
        <application>
            <!-- ... existing application contents -->
        </application>
    </manifest>

    ```

03. Configure your dependencies



    Add the following entries to the `:app` `build.gradle.kts` file (ignore IDE
    suggestion to move them to version catalog for now, if present).



    Ensure that you sync Gradle when all of the above is complete (Android
    Studio should prompt you to do so).











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    plugins {
        // ... existing plugins
        kotlin(\"plugin.serialization\") version \"1.9.0\"
    }

    dependencies {
        // ... existing dependencies
        implementation(\"dev.convex:android-convexmobile:0.4.1@aar\") {
            isTransitive = true
        }
        implementation(\"org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json:1.6.3\")
    }

    ```

04. Install the Convex Backend



    Open a terminal in your Android Studio instance and install the Convex
    client and server library.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npm init -y
    npm install convex

    ```

05. Start Convex



    Start a Convex dev deployment. Follow the command line instructions.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex dev

    ```

06. Create a sample data for your database



    Create a new `sampleData.jsonl` file with these contents.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    {\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

    ```

07. Add the sample data to your database



    Open another terminal tab and run.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

    ```

08. Expose a database query



    Create a `tasks.ts` file in your `convex/` directory with the following
    contents.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

    export const get = query({
      args: {},
      handler: async (ctx) => {
        return await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
      },
    });

    ```

09. Create a data class



    Add a new `data class` to your `MainActivity` to support the task data
    defined above. Import whatever it asks you to.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    @Serializable
    data class Task(val text: String, val isCompleted: Boolean)

    ```

10. Create your UI



    Delete the template `@Composable` functions that Android Studio created and
    add a new one to display data from your Convex deployment. Again, import
    whatever it asks you to.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    @Composable
    fun Tasks(client: ConvexClient, modifier: Modifier = Modifier) {
        var tasks: List<Task> by remember { mutableStateOf(listOf()) }
        LaunchedEffect(key1 = \"launch\") {
            client.subscribe<List<Task>>(\"tasks:get\").collect { result ->
                result.onSuccess { remoteTasks ->
                    tasks = remoteTasks
                }
            }
        }
        LazyColumn(
            modifier = modifier
        ) {
            items(tasks) { task ->
                Text(text = \"Text: ${task.text}, Completed?: ${task.isCompleted}\")
            }
        }
    }

    ```

11. Connect the app to your backend



1. Get the deployment URL of your dev server with
`cat .env.local | grep CONVEX_URL`
2. Update the `onCreate` method in your `MainActivity.kt` to look like

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    enableEdgeToEdge()
    setContent {
        ConvexQuickstartTheme {
            Scaffold(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) { innerPadding ->
                Tasks(
                    client = ConvexClient($YOUR_CONVEX_URL),
                    modifier = Modifier.padding(innerPadding)
                )
            }
        }
    }
}

```

12. Fix any missing imports



    Fix up any missing imports (your import declarations should look something
    like this):











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import android.os.Bundle
    import androidx.activity.ComponentActivity
    import androidx.activity.compose.setContent
    import androidx.activity.enableEdgeToEdge
    import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.fillMaxSize
    import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.padding
    import androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.LazyColumn
    import androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.items
    import androidx.compose.material3.Scaffold
    import androidx.compose.material3.Text
    import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
    import androidx.compose.runtime.LaunchedEffect
    import androidx.compose.runtime.getValue
    import androidx.compose.runtime.mutableStateOf
    import androidx.compose.runtime.remember
    import androidx.compose.runtime.setValue
    import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier
    import dev.convex.android.ConvexClient
    import kotlinx.serialization.Serializable

    ```

13. Run the app



    You can also try adding, updating or deleting documents in your `tasks`
    table at `dashboard.convex.dev` \\- the app will update with the changes in
    real-time.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    From the IDE menu choose \"Run\" > \"Run 'app'\"

    ```

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

There are four reasons why your Convex
[queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) and
[mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) may hit errors:

1. [Application Errors](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling#application-errors-expected-failures): The function
code hits a logical condition that should stop further processing, and your
code throws a `ConvexError`
2. Developer Errors: There is a bug in the function (like calling `db.get(null)`
instead of `db.get(id)`).
3. [Read/Write Limit Errors](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling#readwrite-limit-errors): The function is
retrieving or writing too much data.
4. Internal Convex Errors: There is a problem within Convex (like a network
blip).

Convex will automatically handle internal Convex errors. If there are problems
on our end, we'll automatically retry your queries and mutations until the
problem is resolved and your queries and mutations succeed.

On the other hand, you must decide how to handle application, developer and
read/write limit errors. When one of these errors happens, the best practices
are to:

1. Show the user some appropriate UI.
2. Send the error to an exception reporting service using the
[Exception Reporting Integration](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/exception-reporting).
3. Log the incident using `console.*` and set up reporting with
[Log Streaming](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/log-streams/).
This can be done in addition to the above options, and doesn't require an
exception to be thrown.

Additionally, you might also want to send client-side errors to a service like
[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) to capture additional information for debugging and
observability.

## Errors in queries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling\\#errors-in-queries \"Direct link to Errors in queries\")

If your query function hits an error, the error will be sent to the client and
thrown from your `useQuery` call site. **The best way to handle these errors is**
**with a React**
**[error boundary component](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html).**

Error boundaries allow you to catch errors thrown in their child component tree,
render fallback UI, and send information about the error to your exception
handling service. Adding error boundaries to your app is a great way to handle
errors in Convex query functions as well as other errors in your React
components. If you are using Sentry, you can use their
[`Sentry.ErrorBoundary`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/components/errorboundary/)
component.

With error boundaries, you can decide how granular you'd like your fallback UI
to be. One simple option is to wrap your entire application in a single error
boundary like:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
<StrictMode>
  <ErrorBoundary>
    <ConvexProvider client={convex}>
      <App />
    </ConvexProvider>
  </ErrorBoundary>
</StrictMode>,

```

Then any error in any of your components will be caught by the boundary and
render the same fallback UI.

On the other hand, if you'd like to enable some portions of your app to continue
functioning even if other parts hit errors, you can instead wrap different parts
of your app in separate error boundaries.

Retrying

Unlike other frameworks, there is no concept of \"retrying\" if your query
function hits an error. Because Convex functions are
[deterministic](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#caching-reactivity), if the
query function hits an error, retrying will always produce the same error. There
is no point in running the query function with the same arguments again.

## Errors in mutations [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling\\#errors-in-mutations \"Direct link to Errors in mutations\")

If a mutation hits an error, this will

1. Cause the promise returned from your mutation call to be rejected.
2. Cause your [optimistic update](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/optimistic-updates) to
be rolled back.

If you have an exception service like [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) configured,
it should report \"unhandled promise rejections\" like this automatically. That
means that with no additional work your mutation errors should be reported.

Note that errors in mutations won't be caught by your error boundaries because
the error doesn't happen as part of rendering your components.

If you would like to render UI specifically in response to a mutation failure,
you can use `.catch` on your mutation call. For example:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
sendMessage(newMessageText).catch((error) => {
  // Do something with `error` here
});

```

If you're using an `async` handled function you can also use `try...catch`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
try {
  await sendMessage(newMessageText);
} catch (error) {
  // Do something with `error` here
}

```

Reporting caught errors

If you handle your mutation error, it will no longer become an unhandled promise
rejection. You may need to report this error to your exception handling service
manually.

## Errors in action functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling\\#errors-in-action-functions \"Direct link to Errors in action functions\")

Unlike queries and mutations, [actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions) may have
side-effects and therefore can't be automatically retried by Convex when errors
occur. For example, say your action sends a email. If it fails part-way through,
Convex has no way of knowing if the email was already sent and can't safely
retry the action. It is responsibility of the caller to handle errors raised by
actions and retry if appropriate.

## Differences in error reporting between dev and prod [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling\\#differences-in-error-reporting-between-dev-and-prod \"Direct link to Differences in error reporting between dev and prod\")

Using a dev deployment any server error thrown on the client will include the
original error message and a server-side stack trace to ease debugging.

Using a production deployment any server error will be redacted to only include
the name of the function and a generic `\"Server Error\"` message, with no stack
trace. Server
[application errors](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/application-errors) will
still include their custom `data`.

Both development and production deployments log full errors with stack traces
which can be found on the [Logs](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/logs) page of a
given deployment.

## Application errors, expected failures [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling\\#application-errors-expected-failures \"Direct link to Application errors, expected failures\")

If you have expected ways your functions might fail, you can either return
different values or throw `ConvexError` s.

See [Application Errors](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/application-errors).

## Read/write limit errors [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling\\#readwrite-limit-errors \"Direct link to Read/write limit errors\")

To ensure uptime and guarantee performance, Convex will catch queries and
mutations that try to read or write too much data. These limits are enforced at
the level of a single query or mutation function execution. The limits are:

Queries and mutations error out when:

- More than 16384 documents are scanned
- More than 8MiB worth of data is scanned
- More than 4096 queries calls to `db.get` or `db.query` are made
- The function spends more than 1 second executing Javascript

In addition, mutations error out when:

- More than 8192 documents are written
- More than 8MiB worth of data is written

Documents are \"scanned\" by the database to figure out which documents should be
returned from `db.query`. So for example `db.query(\"table\").take(5).collect()`
will only need to scan 5 documents, but `db.query(\"table\").filter(...).first()`
might scan up to as many documents as there are in `\"table\"`, to find the first
one that matches the given filter.

Number of calls to `db.get` and `db.query` has a limit to prevent a single query
from subscribing to too many index ranges.

In general, if you're running into these limits frequently, we recommend
[indexing your queries](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/) to
reduce the number of documents scanned, allowing you to avoid unnecessary reads.
Queries that scan large swaths of your data may look innocent at first, but can
easily blow up at any production scale. If your functions are close to hitting
these limits they will log a warning.

For information on other limits, see [here](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits).

## Debugging Errors [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling\\#debugging-errors \"Direct link to Debugging Errors\")

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

Each project in Convex has a main production deployment, and each developer on
your team can also set up their own personal development deployment.
Additionally, there are
[preview deployments](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/preview-deployments) used to
test backend changes before they're deployed to production.

While on a [deployment page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment), you may
switch between production, your development deployment, and any preview
deployments by using the dropdown menu on the top-left of the page.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/vue#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

Learn how to query data from Convex in a Vue app.

This quickstart guide uses a [community-maintained](https://docs.convex.dev/client/vue) Vue
client for Convex.

1. Create a Vue site



Create a Vue site using the `npm create vue@latest my-vue-app` command.



Convex will work with any set of options but to follow this quickstart most closely choose:



- Yes to \"Add TypeScript?\"
- No to everything else

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm create vue@latest my-vue-app

```

2. Install the Convex library



To get started, install the `convex` package.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
cd my-vue-app && npm install @convex-vue/core @vueuse/core convex

```

3. Set up a Convex dev deployment



Next, run `npx convex dev`. This
will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.



It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
will then continue running to sync your functions
with your dev deployment in the cloud.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dev

```

4. Create sample data for your database



In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl`
file with some sample data.









sampleData.jsonl





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
{\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
{\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

```

5. Add the sample data to your database



Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table
with the sample data into your Convex database with
the `import` command.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

```

6. Expose a database query



Add a new file `tasks.ts` in the `convex/` folder
with a query function that loads the data.



Exporting a query function from this file
declares an API function named after the file
and the export name, `api.tasks.get`.









convex/tasks.ts





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const get = query({
     args: {},
     handler: async (ctx) => {
       return await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
     },
});

```

7. Wire up the ConvexProvider



In `src/main.ts` set up the Convex client there to make it available on every page of your app.









src/main.ts





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import \"./assets/main.css\";

import { createApp } from \"vue\";
import App from \"./App.vue\";
import { createConvexVue } from \"@convex-vue/core\";

const app = createApp(App);

const convexVue = createConvexVue({
     convexUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL,
});

app.use(convexVue).mount(\"#app\");

```

8. Display the data in your app



In `src/App.vue` use `useQuery` to subscribe your `api.tasks.get`
API function.









src/App.vue





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
<script setup lang=\"ts\">

import { useConvexQuery } from \"@convex-vue/core\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

const { data, isLoading } = useConvexQuery(api.tasks.get, {});
</script>

<template>
     <div class=\"wrapper\">
       <ul v-if=\"!isLoading\">
         <li v-for=\"todo in data\">
           {{ todo.text }} {{ todo.isCompleted ? \"☑\" : \"☐\" }}
         </li>
       </ul>
       <span v-else> loading... </span>
     </div>
</template>

```

9. Start the app



Start the app, open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) in a browser,
and see the list of tasks.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm run dev

```




[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

HTTP actions allow you to build an HTTP API right in Convex!

HTTP actions take in a
[Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and return a
[Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) following
the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
HTTP actions can manipulate the request and response directly, and interact with
data in Convex indirectly by running
[queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions),
[mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions), and
[actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions). HTTP actions might be used for receiving
webhooks from external applications or defining a public HTTP API.

HTTP actions are exposed at `https://<your deployment name>.convex.site` (e.g.
`https://happy-animal-123.convex.site`).

**Example:** [HTTP Actions](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/http)

## Defining HTTP actions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions\\#defining-http-actions \"Direct link to Defining HTTP actions\")

HTTP action handlers are defined using the
[`httpAction`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server#httpaction) constructor, similar to the
`action` constructor for normal actions:

convex/myHttpActions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { httpAction } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const doSomething = httpAction(async () => {
  // implementation will be here
  return new Response();
});

```

The first argument to the `handler` is an
[`ActionCtx`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericActionCtx) object, which provides
[`auth`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Auth),
[`storage`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.StorageActionWriter), and
[`scheduler`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Scheduler), as well as `runQuery`,
`runMutation`, `runAction`.

The second argument contains the
[`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) data. HTTP
actions do not support argument validation, as the parsing of arguments from the
incoming Request is left entirely to you.

Here's an example:

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { httpAction } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { internal } from \"./_generated/api\";

export const postMessage = httpAction(async (ctx, request) => {
  const { author, body } = await request.json();

  await ctx.runMutation(internal.messages.sendOne, {
    body: `Sent via HTTP action: ${body}`,
    author,
  });

  return new Response(null, {
    status: 200,
  });
});

```

To expose the HTTP Action, export an instance of
[`HttpRouter`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/server.HttpRouter) from the
`convex/http.ts` file. To create the instance call
the `httpRouter` function. On the `HttpRouter` you can expose routes using the
`route` method:

convex/http.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { httpRouter } from \"convex/server\";
import { postMessage, getByAuthor, getByAuthorPathSuffix } from \"./messages\";

const http = httpRouter();

http.route({
  path: \"/postMessage\",
  method: \"POST\",
  handler: postMessage,
});

// Define additional routes
http.route({
  path: \"/getMessagesByAuthor\",
  method: \"GET\",
  handler: getByAuthor,
});

// Define a route using a path prefix
http.route({
  // Will match /getAuthorMessages/User+123 and /getAuthorMessages/User+234 etc.
  pathPrefix: \"/getAuthorMessages/\",
  method: \"GET\",
  handler: getByAuthorPathSuffix,
});

// Convex expects the router to be the default export of `convex/http.js`.
export default http;

```

You can now call this action via HTTP and interact with data stored in the
Convex Database. HTTP actions are exposed on
`https://<your deployment name>.convex.site`.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export DEPLOYMENT_NAME=... # example: \"happy-animal-123\"
curl -d '{ \"author\": \"User 123\", \"body\": \"Hello world\" }' \\
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \"https://$DEPLOYMENT_NAME.convex.site/postMessage\"

```

Like other Convex functions, you can view your HTTP actions in the
[Functions view](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/functions) of
[your dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/) and view logs produced by them
in the [Logs view](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/logs).

## Limits [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions\\#limits \"Direct link to Limits\")

HTTP actions run in the same environment as queries and mutations so also do not
have access to Node.js-specific JavaScript APIs. HTTP actions can call
[actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions), which can run in Node.js.

Like [actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions#error-handling), HTTP actions may
have side-effects and will not be automatically retried by Convex when errors
occur. It is a responsibility of the caller to handle errors and retry the
request if appropriate.

Request and response size is limited to 20MB.

HTTP actions support request and response body types of `.text()`, `.json()`,
`.blob()`, and `.arrayBuffer()`.

Note that you don't need to define an HTTP action to call your queries,
mutations and actions over HTTP if you control the caller, since you can use use
the JavaScript [`ConvexHttpClient`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/browser.ConvexHttpClient) or
the [Python client](https://docs.convex.dev/client/python) to call these functions directly.

## Debugging [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions\\#debugging \"Direct link to Debugging\")

### Step 1: Check that your HTTP actions were deployed. [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions\\#step-1-check-that-your-http-actions-were-deployed \"Direct link to Step 1: Check that your HTTP actions were deployed.\")

Check the [functions page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/functions) in
the dashboard and make sure there's an entry called `http`.

If not, double check that you've defined your HTTP actions with the `httpRouter`
in a file called `http.js` or `http.ts` (the name of the file must match
exactly), and that `npx convex dev` has no errors.

### Step 2: Check that you can access your endpoint using curl [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions\\#step-2-check-that-you-can-access-your-endpoint-using-curl \"Direct link to Step 2: Check that you can access your endpoint using curl\")

Get your URL from the dashboard under
[Settings](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/settings) \\> URL and Deploy
Key.

Make sure this is the URL that ends in **`.convex.site`**, and not
`.convex.cloud`. E.g. `https://happy-animal-123.convex.site`

Run a `curl` command to hit one of your defined endpoints, potentially defining
a new endpoint specifically for testing

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
curl -X GET https://<deployment name>.convex.site/myEndpoint

```

Check the [logs page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/logs) in the
dashboard to confirm that there's an entry for your HTTP action.

### Step 3: Check the request being made by your browser [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions\\#step-3-check-the-request-being-made-by-your-browser \"Direct link to Step 3: Check the request being made by your browser\")

If you've determined that your HTTP actions have been deployed and are
accessible via curl, but there are still issues requesting them from your app,
check the exact requests being made by your browser.

Open the _Network_ tab in your browser's developer tools, and trigger your HTTP
requests.

Check that this URL matches what you tested earlier with curl -- it ends in
`.convex.site` and has the right deployment name.

You should be able to see these requests in the dashboard
[logs page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/logs).

If you see \"CORS error\" or messages in the browser console like
`Access to fetch at '...' from origin '...' has been blocked by CORS policy`,
you likely need to configure CORS headers and potentially add a handler for the
pre-flight `OPTIONS` request. See
[this section](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions#cors) below.

## Common patterns [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions\\#common-patterns \"Direct link to Common patterns\")

### File Storage [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions\\#file-storage \"Direct link to File Storage\")

HTTP actions can be used to handle uploading and fetching stored files, see
[File Storage with HTTP actions](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage#file-storage-with-http-actions).

### CORS [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions\\#cors \"Direct link to CORS\")

To make requests to HTTP actions from a website you need to add
[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
headers to your HTTP actions.

There are existing resources for exactly which CORS headers are required based
on the use case. [This site](https://httptoolkit.com/will-it-cors/) provides an
interactive walkthrough for what CORS headers to add. Here's an example of
adding CORS headers to a Convex HTTP action:

convex/http.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { httpRouter } from \"convex/server\";
import { httpAction } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { api } from \"./_generated/api\";
import { Id } from \"./_generated/dataModel\";

const http = httpRouter();

http.route({
  path: \"/sendImage\",
  method: \"POST\",
  handler: httpAction(async (ctx, request) => {
    // Step 1: Store the file
    const blob = await request.blob();
    const storageId = await ctx.storage.store(blob);

    // Step 2: Save the storage ID to the database via a mutation
    const author = new URL(request.url).searchParams.get(\"author\");
    await ctx.runMutation(api.messages.sendImage, { storageId, author });

    // Step 3: Return a response with the correct CORS headers
    return new Response(null, {
      status: 200,
      // CORS headers
      headers: new Headers({
        // e.g. https://mywebsite.com, configured on your Convex dashboard
        \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": process.env.CLIENT_ORIGIN!,
        Vary: \"origin\",
      }),
    });
  }),
});

```

Here's an example of handling a pre-flight `OPTIONS` request:

convex/http.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// Pre-flight request for /sendImage
http.route({
  path: \"/sendImage\",
  method: \"OPTIONS\",
  handler: httpAction(async (_, request) => {
    // Make sure the necessary headers are present
    // for this to be a valid pre-flight request
    const headers = request.headers;
    if (
      headers.get(\"Origin\") !== null &&
      headers.get(\"Access-Control-Request-Method\") !== null &&
      headers.get(\"Access-Control-Request-Headers\") !== null
    ) {
      return new Response(null, {
        headers: new Headers({
          // e.g. https://mywebsite.com, configured on your Convex dashboard
          \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": process.env.CLIENT_ORIGIN!,
          \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": \"POST\",
          \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": \"Content-Type, Digest\",
          \"Access-Control-Max-Age\": \"86400\",
        }),
      });
    } else {
      return new Response();
    }
  }),
});

```

### Authentication [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions\\#authentication \"Direct link to Authentication\")

You can leverage Convex's built-in [authentication](https://docs.convex.dev/auth) integration
and access a user identity from
[`ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Auth#getuseridentity). To
do this call your endpoint with an `Authorization` header including a JWT token:

myPage.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const jwtToken = \"...\";

fetch(\"https://<deployment name>.convex.site/myAction\", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${jwtToken}`,
  },
});

```

Convex uses code generation to create code that is specific to your app's data
model and API. Convex generates JavaScript files ( `.js`) with TypeScript type
definitions ( `.d.ts`).

Code generation isn't required to use Convex, but using the generated code will
give you more better autocompletion in your editor and more type safety if
you're using TypeScript.

To generate the code, run:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dev

```

This creates a `convex/_generated` directory that contains:

- [`api.js` and `api.d.ts`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/api)
- [`dataModel.d.ts`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/data-model)
- [`server.js` and `server.d.ts`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server)

Whether building RAG enabled chatbots or quick search in your applications,
Convex provides easy apis to create powerful AI and search enabled products.

[Vector Search](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search) enables searching for documents
based on their semantic meaning. It uses vector embeddings to calculate
similarity and retrieve documents that are similar to a given query. Vector
search is a key part of common AI techniques like RAG.

[Full Text Search](https://docs.convex.dev/search/text-search) enables keyword and phrase search
within your documents. It supports both prefix and fuzzy matching. Convex full
text search is also reactive and always up to date like all Convex queries,
making it easy to build reliable quick search boxes.

[Convex Actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions) easily enable you to call AI apis, save data
to your database, and drive your user interface. See examples of how you can use
this to [build sophisticated AI applications](https://stack.convex.dev/tag/AI).

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/rust#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

Learn how to query data from Convex in a Rust app with Tokio.

1. Create a Cargo project



Create a new Cargo project.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
cargo new my_app
cd my_app

```

2. Install the Convex client and server libraries



To get started, install the `convex` npm
package which enables you to write your
backend.



And also install the `convex` Rust client library,
the `tokio` runtime, and `dotenvy` for working with `.env` files.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm init -y && npm install convex && cargo add convex tokio dotenvy

```

3. Set up a Convex dev deployment



Next, run `npx convex dev`. This
will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.



It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
will then continue running to sync your functions
with your dev deployment in the cloud.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dev

```

4. Create sample data for your database



In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl`
file with some sample data.









sampleData.jsonl





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
{\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
{\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

```

5. Add the sample data to your database



Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table
with the sample data into your Convex database with
the `import` command.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

```

6. Expose a database query



Add a new file `tasks.js` in the `convex/` folder
with a query function that loads the data.



Exporting a query function from this file
declares an API function named after the file
and the export name, `\"tasks:get\"`.









convex/tasks.js





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const get = query({
     handler: async ({ db }) => {
       return await db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
     },
});

```

7. Connect the app to your backend



In the file `src/main.rs`, create a `ConvexClient` and use it
to fetch from your `\"tasks:get\"` API.









src/main.rs





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
use std::{
       collections::BTreeMap,
       env,
};

use convex::ConvexClient;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
       dotenvy::from_filename(\".env.local\").ok();
       dotenvy::dotenv().ok();

       let deployment_url = env::var(\"CONVEX_URL\").unwrap();

       let mut client = ConvexClient::new(&deployment_url).await.unwrap();
       let result = client.query(\"tasks:get\", BTreeMap::new()).await.unwrap();
       println!(\"{result:#?}\");
}

```

8. Run the app



Run the app and see the serialized list of tasks.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
cargo run

```

## Custom Domains [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/custom\\#custom-domains \"Direct link to Custom Domains\")

You can configure a custom domain, like `api.example.com`, to serve HTTP actions
or Convex functions from your production Convex deployments. The settings for
this feature are accessed through the Project Settings page on any of your
projects.

![Add Custom Domain](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/add_custom_domain-2886f40eb3fd3ab420535fe0e9311908.png)

After you enter a domain, you will be shown which records to set on your DNS
provider. Some popular DNS providers that you can use to buy a domain are
Cloudflare and GoDaddy. We will verify your domain in the background, and once
these records are set, you will see a green checkmark.

When you see that checkmark, your backend will now serve traffic from that
domain. The first request may take up to a minute because Convex will have to
mint a new SSL certificate.

Reach out to [support@convex.dev](mailto:support@convex.dev) if you have any questions about getting set up!

Custom domains require a Convex Pro plan.

Custom domainsrequire a Convex Pro plan. [Learn\\\\
more](https://convex.dev/pricing) about our plans or
[upgrade](https://dashboard.convex.dev/team/settings/billing).

### Hosting with a Custom Domain [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/custom\\#hosting-with-a-custom-domain \"Direct link to Hosting with a Custom Domain\")

To use a custom domain to serve your Convex functions, you'll need additional
configuration in your hosting provider.

The standard build command, `npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'`, will
automatically handle setting the `CONVEX_URL` environment variable (or similarly
named) to the `.convex.cloud` URL for your production deployment, overriding any
other value you have set.

If you're using a custom domain, you'll want to set a different environment
variable in your hosting provider to have the value of your custom domain in the
production environment:
![Vercel import project](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/vercel_custom_domain-e18fdbfcf6c4fe0d10b1958949f74738.png)

Switch the code that instantiates your Convex client to prefer this new value:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
new ConvexReactClient(
  import.meta.env.VITE_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_CONVEX_URL ??
    import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL,
);

```

You can confirm this works by checking the network tab in your browser's
developer tools.

## Custom Hosting [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/custom\\#custom-hosting \"Direct link to Custom Hosting\")

If you're using only Convex for backend functionality you can host your web app
on any static hosting provider. This guide will use
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as an example.

If you're using Next.js or other framework with server functionality you'll need
to use a provider that supports it, such as
[Netlify](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/netlify) or
[Vercel](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/vercel). You can still host Next.js
statically via a
[static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).

### Configure your build [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/custom\\#configure-your-build \"Direct link to Configure your build\")

First make sure that you have a working build process.

In this guide we'll set up a local build, but your hosting provider might
support a remote build. For example see
[Vite's Deploying to GitHub Pages guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#github-pages)
which uses GitHub actions.

We'll use Vite and GitHub Pages as an example.

1. Configure `vite.config.mts`:







vite.config.mts







TS

















```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { defineConfig } from \"vite\";
import react from \"@vitejs/plugin-react\";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [react()],
     build: {
       outDir: \"docs\",
     },
     base: \"/some-repo-name/\",
});

```









The `build.outDir` field specifies where Vite will place the production
build, and we use `docs` because that's the directory GitHub Pages allow
hosting from.

The `base` field specifies the URL path under which you'll serve your app, in
this case we will serve on
`https://<some username>.github.io/<some repo name>`.


### Configure your hosting provider [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/custom\\#configure-your-hosting-provider \"Direct link to Configure your hosting provider\")

With GitHub Pages, you can choose whether you want to include your build output
in your main working branch or publish from a separate branch.

Open your repository's GitHub page > _Settings_ \\> _Pages_. Under _Build and_
_deployment_ \\> _Source_ choose `Deploy from a branch`.

Under _branch_ choose a branch (if you want to use a separate branch, push at
least one commit to it first), and the `/docs` folder name. Hit _Save_.

### Build and deploy to Convex and GitHub Pages [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/custom\\#build-and-deploy-to-convex-and-github-pages \"Direct link to Build and deploy to Convex and GitHub Pages\")

To manually deploy to GitHub pages follow these steps:

1. Checkout the branch you chose to publish from
2. Run `npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'` and confirm that you want to
push your current backend code to your **production** deployment
3. Commit the build output changes and push to GitHub.

### How it works [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/custom\\#how-it-works \"Direct link to How it works\")

First, `npx convex deploy` runs through these steps:

1. It sets the `VITE_CONVEX_URL` (or similarly named) environment variable to
your **production** Convex deployment.
2. It invokes the frontend framework build process, via `npm run build`. The
build process reads the environment variable and uses it to point the built
site at your **production** deployment.
3. It deploys your backend code, from the `convex` directory, to your
**production** deployment.

Afterwards you deploy the built frontend code to your hosting provider. In this
case you used Git, but for other providers you might use a different method,
such as an old-school FTP request.

You can use `--cmd-url-env-var-name` to customize the variable name used by your
frontend code if the `deploy` command cannot infer it, like

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy --cmd-url-env-var-name CUSTOM_CONVEX_URL --cmd 'npm run build'

```

### Authentication [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/custom\\#authentication \"Direct link to Authentication\")

You will want to configure your [authentication](https://docs.convex.dev/auth) provider
(Clerk, Auth0 or other) to accept your production URL, where your frontend is
served.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

Convex lets you easily schedule a function to run once or repeatedly in the
future. This allows you to build durable workflows like sending a welcome email
a day after someone joins or regularly reconciling your accounts with Stripe.
Convex provides two different features for scheduling:

- [Scheduled Functions](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions) can be
scheduled durably by any other function to run at a later point in time. You
can schedule functions minutes, days, and even months in the future.
- [Cron Jobs](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs) schedule functions to run on a
recurring basis, such as daily.

Learn how to query data from Convex in a Bun project.

For instructions for subscriptions instead of point-in-time queries see
[Bun notes](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript/bun).

# Using Convex with Bun

1. Create a new Bun project



Create a new directory for your Bun project.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
mkdir my-project && cd my-project && bun init -y

```

2. Install the Convex client and server library



Install the `convex` package.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
bun add convex

```

3. Set up a Convex dev deployment



Next, run `bunx convex dev`. This
will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.



It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
will then continue running to sync your functions
with your dev deployment in the cloud.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
bunx convex dev

```

4. Create sample data for your database



In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl`
file with some sample data.









sampleData.jsonl





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
{\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
{\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

```

5. Add the sample data to your database



Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table
with the sample data into your Convex database with
the `import` command.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
bunx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

```

6. Expose a database query



Add a new file `tasks.js` in the `convex/` folder
with a query function that loads the data.



Exporting a query function from this file
declares an API function named after the file
and the export name, `api.tasks.get`.









convex/tasks.js





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const get = query({
     args: {},
     handler: async (ctx) => {
       return await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
     },
});

```

7. Connect the script to your backend



In a new file `index.ts`, create a `ConvexClient` using
the URL of your development environment.









index.ts





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { ConvexClient } from \"convex/browser\";
import { api } from \"./convex/_generated/api.js\";

const client = new ConvexClient(process.env[\"CONVEX_URL\"]);

const unsubscribe = client.onUpdate(api.tasks.get, {}, async (tasks) => {
     console.log(tasks);
});

await Bun.sleep(1000);
unsubscribe();
await client.close();

```

8. Run the script



Run the script from the same directory and see the list of tasks logged to the terminal.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
bun index.ts

```

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/occ#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

In [Queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions), we mentioned that determinism
as important in the way optimistic concurrency control (OCC) was used within
Convex. In this section, we'll dive much deeper into _why_.

## Convex Financial, Inc. [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/occ\\#convex-financial-inc \"Direct link to Convex Financial, Inc.\")

Imagine that you're building a banking app, and therefore your databases stores
accounts with balances. You want your users to be able to give each other money,
so you write a mutation function that transfers funds from one user's account to
another.

One run of that transaction might read Alice's account balance, and then Bob's.
You then propose to deduct $5 from Alice's account and increase Bob's balance by
the same $5.

Here's our pseudocode:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
$14 <- READ Alice
$11 <- READ Bob
WRITE Alice $9
WRITE Bob $16

```

This ledger balance transfer is a classic database scenario that requires a
guarantee that these write operations will only apply together. It is a really
bad thing if only one operation succeeds!

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
$14 <- READ Alice
$11 <- READ Bob
WRITE Alice $9
*crash* // $5 lost from your bank

```

You need a guarantee that this can never happen. You require transaction
atomicity, and Convex provides it.

The problem of data correctness is much deeper. Concurrent transactions that
read and edit the same records can create _data races_.

In the case of our app it's entirely possible that someone deducts Alice's
balance right after we read it. Maybe she bought a Coke Zero at the airport with
her debit card for $3.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
$5 Transfer                           $3 Debit Card Charge
----------------------------------------------------------
$14 <- READ Alice
$11 <- READ Bob
                                        $14 <- READ Alice
                                        WRITE Alice $11
WRITE Alice $9 // Free coke!
WRITE Bob $16

```

Clearly, we need to prevent these types of data races from happening. We need a
way to handle these concurrent conflicts. Generally, there are two common
approaches.

Most traditional databases choose a _pessimistic locking_ strategy. (Pessimism
in this case means the strategy assumes conflict will happen ahead of time so
seeks to prevent it.) With pessimistic locking, you first need to acquire a lock
on Alice's record, and then acquire a lock on Bob's record. Then you can proceed
to conduct your transaction, knowing that any other transaction that needed to
touch those records will wait until you are done and all your writes are
committed.

After decades of experience, the drawbacks of pessimistic locking are well
understood and undeniable. The biggest limitation arises from real-life networks
and computers being inherently unreliable. If the lock holder goes missing for
whatever reason half way through its transaction, everyone else that wants to
modify any of those records is waiting indefinitely. Not good!

Optimistic concurrency control is, as the name states, optimistic. It assumes
the transaction will succeed and doesn't worry about locking anything ahead of
time. Very brash! How can it be so sure?

It does this by treating the transaction as a _declarative proposal_ to write
records on the basis of any read record versions (the \"read set\"). At the end of
the transaction, the writes all commit if every version in the read set is still
the latest version of that record. This means no concurrent conflict occurred.

Now using our version read set, let's see how OCC would have prevented the
soda-catastrophe above:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
$5 Transfer                           $3 Debit Card Charge
----------------------------------------------------------
(v1, $14) <- READ Alice
(v7, $11) <- READ Bob
                                        (v1, $14) <- READ Alice
                                        WRITE Alice $11
                                        IF Alice.v = v1

WRITE Alice = $9, Bob = $16
    IF Alice.v = v1, Bob.v = v7 // Fails! Alice is = v2

```

This is akin to being unable to push your Git repository because you're not at
HEAD. We all know in that circumstance, we need to pull, and rebase or merge,
etc.

## When OCC loses, determinism wins [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/occ\\#when-occ-loses-determinism-wins \"Direct link to When OCC loses, determinism wins\")

A naive optimistic concurrency control solution would be to solve this the same
way that Git does: require the user/application to resolve the conflict and
determine if it is safe to retry.

In Convex, however, we don't need to do that. We know the transaction is
deterministic. It didn't charge money to Stripe, it didn't write a permanent
value out to the filesystem. It had no effect at all other than proposing some
atomic changes to Convex tables that were not applied.

The determinism means that we can simply re-run the transaction; you never need
to worry about temporary data races. We can run several retries if necessary
until we succeed to execute the transaction without any conflicts.

tip

In fact, the Git analogy stays very apt. An OCC conflict means we cannot push
because our HEAD is out of date, so we need to rebase our changes and try again.
And determinism is what guarantees there is never a \"merge conflict\", so (unlike
with Git) this rebase operation will always eventually succeed without developer
intervention.

## Snapshot Isolation vs Serializability [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/occ\\#snapshot-isolation-vs-serializability \"Direct link to Snapshot Isolation vs Serializability\")

It is common for optimistic multi-version concurrency control databases to
provide a guarantee of
[snapshot isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_isolation). This
[isolation level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems))
provides the illusion that all transactions execute on an atomic snapshot of the
data but it is vulnerable to
[anomalies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_isolation#Definition) where
certain combinations of concurrent transactions can yield incorrect results. The
implementation of optimistic concurrency control in Convex instead provides true
[serializability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serializability) and will yield
correct results regardless of what transactions are issued concurrently.

## No need to think about this [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/occ\\#no-need-to-think-about-this \"Direct link to No need to think about this\")

The beauty of this approach is that you can simply write your mutation functions
as if they will _always succeed_, and always be guaranteed to be atomic.

Aside from sheer curiosity about how Convex works, day to day there's no need to
worry about conflicts, locking, or atomicity when you make changes to your
tables and documents. The \"obvious way\" to write your mutation functions will
just work.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/netlify#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

Hosting your Convex app on Netlify allows you to automatically re-deploy both
your backend and your frontend whenever you push your code.

## Deploying to Netlify [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/netlify\\#deploying-to-netlify \"Direct link to Deploying to Netlify\")

This guide assumes you already have a working React app with Convex. If not
follow the [Convex React Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/react) first. Then:

1. Create a Netlify account



If you haven't done so, create a [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) account.
This is free for small projects and should take less than a minute to set
up.

2. Link your project on Netlify



Create a Netlify project at [https://app.netlify.com/start](https://app.netlify.com/start) and link it to the
source code repository for your project on GitHub or other Git platform.









![Netlify import project](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/netlify_import-a65616c6c06a44eacbd8dd6a58e9ec6b.png)

3. Override the Build command



Override the _Build command_ to be
`npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'`.



If your project lives in a subdirectory of your repository you'll
also need to change _Base directory_ in Netlify accordingly.









![Netlify build settings](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/netlify_build_settings-3003b87fdb3b152f78ef5e794fb43c4c.png)

4. Set up the CONVEX\\_DEPLOY\\_KEY environment variable



On your [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/)
go to your project's _Settings_ page. Click the _Generate_ button to generate a **Production** deploy key.
Then click the copy button to copy the key.



In Netlify, click _Add environment variables_ and _New variable_.



Create an environment variable `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` and paste
in your deploy key.









![Netlify environment variable CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/netlify_prod_deploy_key-e92a5b4d1f17a3c7df3612f3574f3cdf.png)

5. Deploy your site



Now click the _Deploy_ button and your work here is done!


Netlify will automatically publish your site to a URL
`https://<site-name>.netlify.app` listed at the top of the site overview page.
Every time you push to your git repository, Netlify will automatically deploy
your Convex functions and publish your site changes.

Using a Custom Domain?

If you're using a custom domain to serve your Convex functions, you'll need
additional configuration. See [Custom\\\\
Domains](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/custom#hosting-with-a-custom-domain) for
more information.

### How it works [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/netlify\\#how-it-works \"Direct link to How it works\")

In Netlify, we overrode the _Build Command_ to be
`npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'`.

`npx convex deploy` will read `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` from the environment and use
it to set the `CONVEX_URL` (or similarly named) environment variable to point to
your **production** deployment.

Your frontend framework of choice invoked by `npm run build` will read the
`CONVEX_URL` environment variable and point your deployed site (via
`ConvexReactClient`) at your **production** deployment.

Finally, `npx convex deploy` will push your Convex functions to your production
deployment.

Now, your production deployment has your newest functions and your app is
configured to connect to it.

You can use `--cmd-url-env-var-name` to customize the variable name used by your
frontend code if the `deploy` command cannot infer it, like

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy --cmd-url-env-var-name CUSTOM_CONVEX_URL --cmd 'npm run build'

```

## Authentication [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/netlify\\#authentication \"Direct link to Authentication\")

You will want to configure your [authentication](https://docs.convex.dev/auth) provider
(Clerk, Auth0 or other) to accept your production `<site-name>.netlify.app` URL.

## Deploy Previews [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/netlify\\#deploy-previews \"Direct link to Deploy Previews\")

Netlify's Deploy Previews allow you to preview changes to your app before
they're merged in. In order to preview both changes to frontend code and Convex
functions, you can set up
[Convex preview deployments](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/preview-deployments).

This will create a fresh Convex backend for each preview and leave your
production and development deployments unaffected.

This assumes you have already followed the steps in
[Deploying to Netlify](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/netlify#deploying-to-netlify) above.

1. Set up the CONVEX\\_DEPLOY\\_KEY environment variable



On your [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/)
go to your project's _Settings_ page. Click the _Generate Preview Deploy Key_ button to generate a **Preview** deploy key.
Then click the copy button to copy the key.



In Netlify, click _Site configuration_ \\> _Environment variables_. Edit your existing `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` environment variable.
Select _Different value for each deploy context_ and paste the key under _Deploy Previews_.









![Netlify environment variable CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/netlify_preview_deploy_key-51d8c3210b827a6946d8f9997987616a.png)

2. (optional) Set up default environment variables



If your app depends on certain Convex environment variables, you can set up [default\\\\
environment variables](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables#project-environment-variable-defaults) for preview and development deployments in your project.









![Project Default Environment Variables](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/project_default_environment_variables-94be77c692d0a3c9564cb7f642b6cb64.png)

3. (optional) Run a function to set up initial data



Deploy Previews run against fresh Convex backends, which do not share data
with development or production Convex deployments. You can call a Convex
function to set up data by adding `--preview-run 'functionName'` to the `npx   convex deploy` command. This function will only be run for preview deployments, and will be ignored
when deploying to production.









Netlify > Site configuration > Build & deploy > Build settings > Build command





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build' --preview-run 'functionName'

```

4. Now test out creating a PR and generating a Deploy Preview!



You can find the Convex deployment for your branch in the Convex dashboard.









![Preview Deployment in Deployment Picker](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/preview_deployment_deployment_picker-bc5b5e7cd3ac7e0e44ec7ed4c8b40c1c.png)


### How it works [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/netlify\\#how-it-works-1 \"Direct link to How it works\")

For Deploy Previews, `npx convex deploy` will read `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` from the
environment, and use it to create a Convex deployment associated with the Git
branch name for the Deploy Preview. It will set the `CONVEX_URL` (or similarly
named) environment variable to point to the new Convex deployment.

Your frontend framework of choice invoked by `npm run build` will read the
`CONVEX_URL` environment variable and point your deployed site (via
`ConvexReactClient`) at the Convex preview deployment.

Finally, `npx convex deploy` will push your Convex functions to the preview
deployment and run the `--preview-run` function (if provided). This deployment
has separate functions, data, crons and all other configuration from any other
deployments.

`npx convex deploy` will infer the Git branch name for Vercel, Netlify, GitHub,
and GitLab environments, but the `--preview-create` option can be used to
customize the name associated with the newly created deployment.

Production deployments will work exactly the same as before.

On this page

Convex doesn’t have explicit support for many languages including Go, Java, and
C++. However, you can generate [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/)
specifications from your Convex deployment to create type-safe clients for
languages that aren't currently supported. Under the hood, this uses our
[HTTP API](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api). This means that your queries will not be
reactive/real-time.

OAS generation is in beta

OAS generationis currently a [beta\\\\
feature](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/#beta-features). If you have feedback or feature
requests, [let us know on Discord](https://convex.dev/community)!

## Setup [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/open-api\\#setup \"Direct link to Setup\")

1. Install the Convex Helpers npm package



Install the `convex-helpers` package, which contains a CLI command to generate an Open API specification.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm install convex-helpers

```

2. Run a command to generate an OpenAPI specification



Running this command will call into your configured Convex deployment and generate an `convex-spec.yaml` file based
on it. You can see additional flags by passing `--help` to the command.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex-helpers open-api-spec

```

3. Generate a type-safe client



You can use a separate tools to generate a client from the `convex-spec.yaml` file. Some popular options are [OpenAPI Tools](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) and [Swagger](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/).











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
# convex-spec.yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
     title: Convex App - OpenAPI 3.0
     version: 0.0.0
     servers:
    - url: \"{hostUrl}\"
description: Convex App API
...

```

## Example [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/open-api\\#example \"Direct link to Example\")

Below are code snippets of what this workflow looks like in action. These
snippets include two different files:

- `convex/load.ts` \\- contains Convex function definitions
- `convex.go` \\- contains `Go` code that uses a generated, type-safe `HTTP`
client. This client was generated by installing the
[OpenAPI Tools](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) package and
running the command
`npx openapi-generator-cli generate -i convex-spec.yaml -g go -o convex_client`

convex/load.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { v } from \"convex/values\";
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { LinkTable } from \"./schema\";

export const loadOne = query({
args: { normalizedId: v.string(), token: v.string() },
returns: v.union(
    v.object({
      ...LinkTable.validator.fields,
      _creationTime: v.number(),
      _id: v.id(\"links\"),
    }),
    v.null(),
),
handler: async (ctx, { normalizedId, token }) => {
    if (token === \"\" || token !== process.env.CONVEX_AUTH_TOKEN) {
      throw new Error(\"Invalid authorization token\");
    }
    return await ctx.db
      .query(\"links\")
      .withIndex(\"by_normalizedId\", (q) => q.eq(\"normalizedId\", normalizedId))
      .first();
},
});

```

convex.go

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
type Link struct {
	Short    string // the \"foo\" part of http://go/foo
	Long     string // the target URL or text/template pattern to run
	Created  time.Time
	LastEdit time.Time // when the link was last edited
	Owner    string    // user@domain
}

func (c *ConvexDB) Load(short string) (*Link, error) {
request := *convex.NewRequestLoadLoadOne(*convex.NewRequestLoadLoadOneArgs(short, c.token))
resp, httpRes, err := c.client.QueryAPI.ApiRunLoadLoadOnePost(context.Background()).RequestLoadLoadOne(request).Execute()
validationErr := validateResponse(httpRes.StatusCode, err, resp.Status) if
validationErr != nil { return nil, validationErr }

linkDoc := resp.Value.Get()
if linkDoc == nil {
    err := fs.ErrNotExist
    return nil, err
}
link := Link{
    Short:    linkDoc.Short,
    Long:     linkDoc.Long,
    Created:  time.Unix(int64(linkDoc.Created), 0),
    LastEdit: time.Unix(int64(linkDoc.LastEdit), 0),
    Owner:    linkDoc.Owner,
}

return &link, nil

```

## Limits [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/open-api\\#limits \"Direct link to Limits\")

- Argument and return value validators are not required, but they will enrich
the types of your OpenAPI spec. Where validators aren't defined, we default to
`v.any()` as the validator.
- You cannot call internal functions from outside of your Convex deployment.
- We currently do not support `bigints` or `bytes`.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/nextjs#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

Convex + Next.js

Convex is an all-in-one backend and database that integrates quickly and easily
with Next.js.

Once you've gotten started, see how to set up
[hosting](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/) [server rendering](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs/server-rendering), and
[auth](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs/).

To get setup quickly with Convex and Next.js run

**`npm create convex@latest`**

**``**

or follow the guide below.

* * *

Learn how to query data from Convex in a Next.js app using the App Router
and

TypeScript

Alternatively see the
[Pages Router](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs-pages-router/quickstart)
version of this quickstart.

01. Create a React app



    Create a Next.js app using the `npx create-next-app` command.



    Choose the default option for every prompt (hit Enter).











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx create-next-app@latest my-app

    ```

02. Install the Convex client and server library



    To get started, install the `convex`
    package which provides a convenient interface for working
    with Convex from a React app.



    Navigate to your app and install `convex`.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    cd my-app && npm install convex

    ```

03. Set up a Convex dev deployment



    Next, run `npx convex dev`. This
    will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
    create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.



    It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
    to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
    will then continue running to sync your functions
    with your dev deployment in the cloud.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex dev

    ```

04. Create sample data for your database



    In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl`
    file with some sample data.









    sampleData.jsonl





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    {\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

    ```

05. Add the sample data to your database



    Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table
    with the sample data into your Convex database with
    the `import` command.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

    ```

06. Expose a database query



    Add a new file `tasks.ts` in the `convex/` folder
    with a query function that loads the data.



    Exporting a query function from this file
    declares an API function named after the file
    and the export name, `api.tasks.get`.













    convex/tasks.ts







    TS

















    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

    export const get = query({
      args: {},
      handler: async (ctx) => {
        return await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
      },
    });

    ```

07. Create a client component for the Convex provider



    Add a new file `ConvexClientProvider.tsx` in the `app/` folder. Include the `\"use client\";` directive, create a
    `ConvexReactClient` and a component that wraps its children in a `ConvexProvider`.













    app/ConvexClientProvider.tsx







    TS

















    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    \"use client\";

    import { ConvexProvider, ConvexReactClient } from \"convex/react\";
    import { ReactNode } from \"react\";

    const convex = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL!);

    export function ConvexClientProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
      return <ConvexProvider client={convex}>{children}</ConvexProvider>;
    }

    ```

08. Wire up the ConvexClientProvider



    In `app/layout.tsx`, wrap the children of the `body` element with the `ConvexClientProvider`.













    app/layout.tsx







    TS

















    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import type { Metadata } from \"next\";
    import { Geist, Geist_Mono } from \"next/font/google\";
    import \"./globals.css\";
    import { ConvexClientProvider } from \"./ConvexClientProvider\";

    const geistSans = Geist({
      variable: \"--font-geist-sans\",
      subsets: [\"latin\"],
    });

    const geistMono = Geist_Mono({
      variable: \"--font-geist-mono\",
      subsets: [\"latin\"],
    });

    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title: \"Create Next App\",
      description: \"Generated by create next app\",
    };

    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: Readonly<{
      children: React.ReactNode;
    }>) {
      return (
        <html lang=\"en\">
          <body
            className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}
          >
            <ConvexClientProvider>{children}</ConvexClientProvider>
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }

    ```

09. Display the data in your app



    In `app/page.tsx`, use the `useQuery` hook to fetch from your `api.tasks.get`
    API function.













    app/page.tsx







    TS

















    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    \"use client\";

    import Image from \"next/image\";
    import { useQuery } from \"convex/react\";
    import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

    export default function Home() {
      const tasks = useQuery(api.tasks.get);
      return (
        <main className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24\">
          {tasks?.map(({ _id, text }) => <div key={_id}>{text}</div>)}
        </main>
      );
    }

    ```

10. Start the app



    Start the app, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in a browser,
    and see the list of tasks.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npm run dev

    ```

# Convex Tutorial: Scaling your app

Convex was designed from the ground up for scale. In the previous section we
already talked about how keeping your actions small and most of your logic in
queries and mutations are crucial to building fast scalable backends.

Let's talk about a few other ways to keep your app fast and scalable.

## Indexed queries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/scale\\#indexed-queries \"Direct link to Indexed queries\")

Indexes tell the database to create a lookup structure to make it really fast to
filter data. If, in our chat app we wanted to build a way to look up `messages`
from just one user, we'd tell Convex to index the `user` field in the `messages`
table and write the query with the `withIndex` syntax.

[Learn how to use indexes](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/).

## Too many writes on the same document [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/scale\\#too-many-writes-on-the-same-document \"Direct link to Too many writes on the same document\")

Let's say you decide to show a counter in your app. You may write a mutation
that reads a number field, adds 1, and updates the same field in the database.
At some point, this pattern may cause an
[optimistic concurrency control conflict](https://docs.convex.dev/error#1). That means that the
database isn't able to handle updating the document that fast. All databases
have trouble with this sort of pattern.

There are a [few ways to deal with this](https://docs.convex.dev/error#remediation), including building
something called a sharded counter...

But before you go learn advanced scaling techniques on your own, there is a
better way with Convex components.

## Scaling best practices with Convex Components [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/scale\\#scaling-best-practices-with-convex-components \"Direct link to Scaling best practices with Convex Components\")

In the case of the counter above, the Convex team has already built a
[scalable counter](https://www.convex.dev/components/sharded-counter) Convex
component for you to use.

Convex components are installed in your Convex backend as an npm library. They
are sandboxed, so they can't read your app's tables or call your app's functions
unless explicitly provided.

As you build more complicated features like AI agent
[workflows](https://www.convex.dev/components/workflow),
[leaderboards](https://www.convex.dev/components/aggregate),
[feature flags](https://www.convex.dev/components/launchdarkly) or
[rate limiters](https://www.convex.dev/components/rate-limiter), you may find
that there is already a Convex component that solves this problem.

[**Components directory**](https://www.convex.dev/components)

## Wrap up [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/scale\\#wrap-up \"Direct link to Wrap up\")

We've covered a lot of ground in this tutorial. We started by
[building a chat app](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/) with queries, mutations and the
database that form the fundamental building blocks of the Convex sync engine. We
then called an [external API](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/actions) from our backend,
using the scheduler to coordinate the work. Finally, we learned that
[Convex components](https://www.convex.dev/components) give you scaling best
practices in neat packages.

If you are looking for more tips, read our
[best practices](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/) and join
the [community](https://www.convex.dev/community).

Convex enables you to build your MVP fast and then scale to new heights. Many
great products have already done so. You're in good company.



[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

The Convex Swift client library enables your iOS or macOS application to
interact with your Convex backend. It allows your frontend code to:

1. Call
your [queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions), [mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) and [actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions)
2. Authenticate users using [Auth0](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0)

The library is open source
and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-swift).

Follow the [Swift Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/swift) to get started.

## Installation [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift\\#installation \"Direct link to Installation\")

For an iOS or macOS project in Xcode, you’ll need to perform the following steps
to add a dependency on the `ConvexMobile` library.

1. Click on the top-level app container in the project navigator on the left

2. Click on the app name under the PROJECT heading

3. Click the _Package Dependencies_ tab

4. Click the + button

![Screenshot 2024-10-02 at 2.33.43 PM.png](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/swift_qs_step_2-4edae92b06d29aba638512edc3fcc267.png)

5. Paste
[`https://github.com/get-convex/convex-swift`](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-swift)
into the search box and press Enter

6. When the `convex-swift` package loads, click the Add Package button

7. In the _Package Products_ dialog, select your product name in the _Add to_
_Target_ dropdown

8. Click _Add Package_


## Connecting to a backend [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift\\#connecting-to-a-backend \"Direct link to Connecting to a backend\")

The `ConvexClient` is used to establish and maintain a connection between your
application and the Convex backend. First you need to create an instance of the
client by giving it your backend deployment URL:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import ConvexMobile

let convex = ConvexClient(deploymentUrl: \"https://<your domain here>.convex.cloud\")

```

You should create and use one instance of the `ConvexClient` for the lifetime of
your application process. You can store the client in a global constant like
shown above. An actual connection to the Convex backend won’t be initiated until
you call a method on the `ConvexClient`. After that it will maintain the
connection and re-establish it if it gets dropped.

## Fetching data [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift\\#fetching-data \"Direct link to Fetching data\")

The Swift Convex library gives you access to the Convex sync engine, which
enables real-time _subscriptions_ to query results. You subscribe to queries
with the `subscribe` method on `ConvexClient` which returns
a [`Publisher`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine). The data
available via the `Publisher` will change over time as the underlying data
backing the query changes.

You can call methods on the `Publisher` to transform and consume the data it
provides.

A simple way to consume a query that returns a list of strings in a `View` is to
use a combination of a `@State` containing a list and the `.task` modifier with
code that loops over the query results as an `AsyncSequence`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
struct ColorList: View {
  @State private var colors: [String] = []

  var body: some View {
    List {
      ForEach(colors, id: \\.self) { color in
        Text(color)
      }
    }.task {
      let latestColors = convex.subscribe(to: \"colors:get\", yielding: [String].self)
        .replaceError(with: [])
        .values
      for await colors in latestColors {
        self.colors = colors
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Any time the data that powers the backend `\"colors:get\"` query changes, a
new array of `String` values will appear in the `AsyncSequence` and the
`View`'s `colors` list gets assigned the new data. The UI will then rebuild
reactively to reflect the changed data.

### Query arguments [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift\\#query-arguments \"Direct link to Query arguments\")

You can pass arguments to `subscribe` and they will be supplied to the
associated backend `query` function. The arguments must be a Dictionary keyed
with strings and the values should generally be primitive types, Arrays and
other Dictionaries.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
let publisher = convex.subscribe(to: \"colors:get\",
                               with:[\"onlyFavorites\": true],
                           yielding:[String].self)

```

Assuming the `colors:get` query accepts an `onlyFavorites` argument, the value
can be received and used to perform logic in the query function.

tip

Use [Decodable structs](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift/data-types#custom-data-types)
to automatically convert Convex objects to Swift structs.

caution

- There are important gotchas when
[sending and receiving numbers](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift/data-types#numerical-types)
between Swift and Convex.
- Depending on your backend functions, you may need to deal with
[reserved Swift keywords](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift/data-types#field-name-conversion).

### Subscription lifetime [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift\\#subscription-lifetime \"Direct link to Subscription lifetime\")

The `Publisher` returned from `subscribe` will persist as long as the associated
`View` or `ObservableObject`. When either is no longer part of the UI, the
underlying query subscription to Convex will be canceled.

## Editing Data [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift\\#editing-data \"Direct link to Editing Data\")

You can use the `mutation` method on `ConvexClient` to trigger a
backend [mutation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions).

`mutation` is an `async` method so you'll need to call it within a `Task`.
Mutations can return a value or not.

Mutations can also receive arguments, just like queries. Here's an example of
calling a mutation with arguments that returns a value:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
let isColorAdded: Bool = try await convex.mutation(\"colors:put\", with: [\"color\": newColor])

```

### Handling errors [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift\\#handling-errors \"Direct link to Handling errors\")

If an error occurs during a call to `mutation`, it will throw. Typically you may
want to
catch [`ConvexError`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/application-errors) and `ServerError` and
handle them however is appropriate in your application.

Here’s a small example of how you might handle an error from `colors:put` if it
threw a `ConvexError` with an error message if a color already existed.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
do {
  try await convex.mutation(\"colors:put\", with: [\"color\": newColor])
} catch ClientError.ConvexError(let data) {
  errorMessage = try! JSONDecoder().decode(String.self, from: Data(data.utf8))
  colorNotAdded = true
}

```

See documentation on [error handling](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/) for more
details.

## Calling third-party APIs [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift\\#calling-third-party-apis \"Direct link to Calling third-party APIs\")

You can use the `action` method on `ConvexClient` to trigger a
backend [action](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions).

Calls to `action` can accept arguments, return values and throw exceptions just
like calls to `mutation`.

Even though you can call actions from your client code, it's not always the
right choice. See the action docs for tips
on [calling actions from clients](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions#calling-actions-from-clients).

## Authentication with Auth0 [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift\\#authentication-with-auth0 \"Direct link to Authentication with Auth0\")

You can use `ConvexClientWithAuth` in place of `ConvexClient` to configure
authentication with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). You'll need
the `convex-swift-auth0` library to do that, as well as an Auth0 account and
application configuration.

See
the [README](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-swift-auth0/blob/main/README.md) in
the `convex-swift-auth0` repo for more detailed setup instructions, and
the [Workout example app](https://github.com/get-convex/ios-convex-workout) which
is configured for Auth0. The
overall [Convex authentication docs](https://docs.convex.dev/auth) are a good resource as
well.

It should also be possible to integrate other similar OpenID Connect
authentication providers. See
the [`AuthProvider`](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-swift/blob/c47aea414c92db2ccf3a0fa4f9db8caf2029b032/Sources/ConvexMobile/ConvexMobile.swift#L188) protocol
in the `convex-swift` repo for more info.

## Production and dev deployments [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift\\#production-and-dev-deployments \"Direct link to Production and dev deployments\")

When you're ready to move toward [production](https://docs.convex.dev/production) for your
app, you can setup your Xcode build system to point different build targets to
different Convex deployments. Build environment configuration is highly
specialized, and it’s possible that you or your team have different conventions,
but this is one way to approach the problem.

1. Create “Dev” and “Prod” folders in your project sources.
2. Add an `Env.swift` file in each one with contents like:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
let deploymentUrl = \"https://$DEV_OR_PROD.convex.cloud\"

```

3. Put your dev URL in `Dev/Env.swift` and your prod URL in `Prod/Env.swift`.
Don’t worry if Xcode complains that `deploymentUrl` is defined multiple
times.
4. Click on your top-level project in the explorer view on the left.
5. Select your build target from the **TARGETS** list.
6. Change the target’s name so it ends in “dev”.
7. Right/Ctrl-click it and duplicate it, giving it a name that ends in “prod”.
8. With the “dev” target selected, click the **Build Phases** tab.
9. Expand the **Compile Sources** section.
10. Select `Prod/Env.swift` and remove it with the - button.
11. Likewise, open the “prod” target and remove `Dev/Env.swift` from its
sources.

![Screenshot 2024-10-03 at 1.34.34 PM.png](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/swift_env_setup-39f43c73bf9c8599957530a43582ca3d.png)

Now you can refer to `deploymentUrl` wherever you create your `ConvexClient` and
depending on the target that you build, it will use your dev or prod URL.

## Structuring your application [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift\\#structuring-your-application \"Direct link to Structuring your application\")

The examples shown in this guide are intended to be brief, and don't provide
guidance on how to structure a whole application.

If you want a more robust and layered approach, put your code that interacts
with `ConvexClient` in a class that conforms to `ObservableObject`. Then your
`View` can observe that object as a `@StateObject` and will rebuild whenever it
changes.

For example, if we adapt the `colors:get` example from above to a
`ViewModel: ObservableObject` class, the `View` no longer plays a direct part in
fetching the data - it only knows that the list of `colors` is provided by the
`ViewModel`.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import SwiftUI

class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
  @Published var colors: [String] = []

  init() {
    convex.subscribe(to: \"colors:get\")
      .replaceError(with: [])
      .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
      .assign(to: &$colors)
  }
}

struct ContentView: View {
  @StateObject var viewModel = ViewModel()

  var body: some View {
    List {
      ForEach(viewModel.colors, id: \\.self) { color in
        Text(color)
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Depending on your needs and the scale of your app, it might make sense to give
it even more formal structure as demonstrated in something like
[https://github.com/nalexn/clean-architecture-swiftui](https://github.com/nalexn/clean-architecture-swiftui).

## Under the hood [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/swift\\#under-the-hood \"Direct link to Under the hood\")

The Swift Convex library is built on top of the
official [Convex Rust client](https://docs.convex.dev/client/rust). It handles maintaining a
WebSocket connection with the Convex backend and implements the full Convex
protocol.

All method calls on `ConvexClient` are handled via a Tokio async runtime on the
Rust side and are safe to call from the application's main actor.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/search/using-cursor#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

[Cursor](https://cursor.com/), the AI code editor, makes it easy to write and
maintain apps built with Convex. Let's walk through how to setup Cursor for the
best possible results with Convex.

# Add Convex to Cursor’s Docs

[Cursor composer agent](https://docs.cursor.com/composer/overview#agent), the
main AI coding agent built into Cursor, uses Claude as it's LLM model of choice.
While Claude knows about Convex, its knowledge can be patchy or outdated.

We need to give it a helping hand by using the
[Cursors Docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs) feature to give
it the most up-to-date knowledge of Convex.

From **`Cursor Settings`** > **`Features`** > **`Docs`** add new doc, use the
URL \" [https://docs.convex.dev/](https://docs.convex.dev/)\"

![Chat UI](<Base64-Image-Removed>)

Cursor will then index all of the Convex docs for the LLM to use.

![Chat UI](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/indexed_docs-90bb59330756c00540015c53da6a484c.webp)

You can then reference those docs in your prompt with the `@Convex` symbol.

![Chat UI](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/reference_convex_docs-c791c41ddbd7663244fda1c4c59a43d9.webp)

Add more Convex knowledge

You can perform the above steps for [https://stack.convex.dev/](https://stack.convex.dev/) too if you would
like to provide even more context to the agent.

# Install and run Convex yourself

Keeping Convex running is crucial because
[it automatically generates](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#run-the-convex-dev-server)
the client-side types. Without this, the agent can get stuck in a linting loop
since it can't access the types for the queries and mutations it created.

We recommended that you install ( `npm install convex`) and run convex
( `npx convex dev`) yourself in a terminal window.

# Use a `convex_instructions.md` to fine-tune Convex behavior even further

Despite Claude’s inbuilt knowledge of Convex plus referencing `@Convex` docs the
LLM does still make silly Convex mistakes from time to time. To reduce this even
more create a `convex_instructions.md` file in `/instructions` directory. Then
reference it from your prompt.

![Chat UI](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/convex_instructions-c857878c3a3726d951cff4e80121743b.webp)

To get you started see this one we have been using:

[convex\\_instructions.md](https://gist.github.com/mikecann/0dc25aeae0d06a88c3da71c1e026ae47)

Copy the above to your project then reference it in your prompts. You can edit
it as needed.

Cursor Notepads

Cursor does have a beta feature called
[Notepads](https://docs.cursor.com/features/beta/notepads#notepads) that may be
a better way to do this in the future.

# Keep your requests small and git commit frequently

The best results when using agentic LLMs can be found when keeping the amount of
changes you want to make small. This lets you be more specific around the
context you provide the agent and it means the agent doesn't need to do a lot of
searching for context.

After each successful prompt or series of prompts it is a good idea to commit
your changes so that its simple to rollback to that point should the next prompt
cause issues.

# Update and reference your `README.md`

The agent needs context about the specific business goals for your project.
While it can infer some details from the files it reads, this becomes more
challenging as your project grows. Providing general information about your
project gives the agent a helpful head start.

Rather than including this information in each prompt, it's better to write a
comprehensive README.md file in your project root and reference it.

[Some people](https://youtu.be/2PjmPU07KNs?t=145) advocate for crafting a
Product Requirements Document (PRD), this may be a good idea for more complex
projects.



[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/tanstack-start#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

TanStack Start is in Alpha

[TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest) is a new React framework
currently in beta. You can try it today but there are likely to be breaking
changes before a stable release.

To get setup quickly with Convex and TanStack Start run

**`npm create convex@latest -- -t tanstack-start`**

**``**

or follow the guide below.

To use Clerk with Convex and TanStack Start, see the
[TanStack Start + Clerk guide](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/tanstack-start/tanstack-start-with-clerk)

* * *

Learn how to query data from Convex in a TanStack Start site.

01. Create a TanStack Start site



    The TanStack team intends to release a CLI template starter soon, but until the
    official way to create a new TanStack Start site is to follow the TanStack Start
    [getting started](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/start/getting-started)
    guide.



    Once you've finished you'll have a directory called myApp with a minimal
    TanStack Start app in it.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    .
    ├── app/
    │   ├── routes/
    │   │   ├── `index.tsx`
    │   │   └── `__root.tsx`
    │   ├── `client.tsx`
    │   ├── `router.tsx`
    │   ├── `routeTree.gen.ts`
    │   └── `ssr.tsx`
    ├── `.gitignore`
    ├── `app.config.ts`
    ├── `package.json`
    └── `tsconfig.json`

    ```

02. Install the Convex client and server library



    To get started with Convex install the `convex` package and a few React Query-related packages.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npm install convex @convex-dev/react-query @tanstack/react-router-with-query @tanstack/react-query

    ```

03. Update app/routes/\\_\\_root.tsx



    Add a `QueryClient` to the router context to make React Query usable anywhere in the TanStack Start site.









    app/routes/\\_\\_root.tsx





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { QueryClient } from \"@tanstack/react-query\";
    import { createRootRouteWithContext } from \"@tanstack/react-router\";
    import { Outlet, ScrollRestoration } from \"@tanstack/react-router\";
    import { Meta, Scripts } from \"@tanstack/start\";
    import * as React from \"react\";

    export const Route = createRootRouteWithContext<{
      queryClient: QueryClient;
    }>()({
      head: () => ({
        meta: [\\
          {\\
            charSet: \"utf-8\",\\
          },\\
          {\\
            name: \"viewport\",\\
            content: \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\\
          },\\
          {\\
            title: \"TanStack Start Starter\",\\
          },\\
        ],
      }),
      component: RootComponent,
    });

    function RootComponent() {
      return (
        <RootDocument>
          <Outlet />
        </RootDocument>
      );
    }

    function RootDocument({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
      return (
        <html>
          <head>
            <Meta />
          </head>
          <body>
            {children}
            <ScrollRestoration />
            <Scripts />
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }

    ```

04. Update app/router.tsx



    Replace the file `app/router.tsx` with these contents.



    This creates a `ConvexClient` and a `ConvexQueryClient` and wires in a `ConvexProvider`.









    app/router.tsx





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { createRouter as createTanStackRouter } from \"@tanstack/react-router\";
    import { QueryClient } from \"@tanstack/react-query\";
    import { routerWithQueryClient } from \"@tanstack/react-router-with-query\";
    import { ConvexQueryClient } from \"@convex-dev/react-query\";
    import { ConvexProvider } from \"convex/react\";
    import { routeTree } from \"./routeTree.gen\";

    export function createRouter() {
      const CONVEX_URL = (import.meta as any).env.VITE_CONVEX_URL!;
      if (!CONVEX_URL) {
        console.error(\"missing envar VITE_CONVEX_URL\");
      }
      const convexQueryClient = new ConvexQueryClient(CONVEX_URL);

      const queryClient: QueryClient = new QueryClient({
        defaultOptions: {
          queries: {
            queryKeyHashFn: convexQueryClient.hashFn(),
            queryFn: convexQueryClient.queryFn(),
          },
        },
      });
      convexQueryClient.connect(queryClient);

      const router = routerWithQueryClient(
        createTanStackRouter({
          routeTree,
          defaultPreload: \"intent\",
          context: { queryClient },
          Wrap: ({ children }) => (
            <ConvexProvider client={convexQueryClient.convexClient}>
              {children}
            </ConvexProvider>
          ),
        }),
        queryClient,
      );

      return router;
    }

    declare module \"@tanstack/react-router\" {
      interface Register {
        router: ReturnType<typeof createRouter>;
      }
    }

    ```

05. Set up a Convex dev deployment



    Next, run `npx convex dev`. This
    will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
    create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.



    It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
    to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
    will then continue running to sync your functions
    with your dev deployment in the cloud.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex dev

    ```

06. Create sample data for your database



    In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl`
    file with some sample data.









    sampleData.jsonl





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    {\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

    ```

07. Add the sample data to your database



    Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table
    with the sample data into your Convex database with
    the `import` command.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

    ```

08. Expose a database query



    Add a new file `tasks.ts` in the `convex/` folder
    with a query function that loads the data.



    Exporting a query function from this file
    declares an API function named after the file
    and the export name, `api.tasks.get`.









    convex/tasks.ts





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

    export const get = query({
      args: {},
      handler: async (ctx) => {
        return await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
      },
    });

    ```

09. Display the data in your app



    Replace the file `app/routes/index.tsx` with these contents.



    The `useSuspenseQuery` hook renders the API function `api.tasks.get`
    query result on the server initially, then it updates live in the browser.









    app/routes/index.tsx





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { convexQuery } from \"@convex-dev/react-query\";
    import { useSuspenseQuery } from \"@tanstack/react-query\";
    import { createFileRoute } from \"@tanstack/react-router\";
    import { api } from \"../../convex/_generated/api\";

    export const Route = createFileRoute(\"/\")({
      component: Home,
    });

    function Home() {
      const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(convexQuery(api.tasks.get, {}));

      return (
        <div>
          {data.map(({ _id, text }) => (
            <div key={_id}>{text}</div>
          ))}
        </div>
      );
    }

    ```

10. Start the app



    Start the app, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in a browser,
    and see the list of tasks.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npm run dev

    ```

# Convex Tutorial: A chat app

Convex provides you with a fully featured backend with cloud functions,
database, scheduling, and a sync engine that keeps your frontend and backend up
to date in real-time.

Today, in about **10 lines of code,** we'll build a backend that reads and
writes to the database and automatically updates all users in a chat app.

After that we'll see how to connect to external services and setup your product
for success and scale.

## Start developing with Convex [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial\\#start-developing-with-convex \"Direct link to Start developing with Convex\")

Before you begin: You'll need Node.js 18+ and Git

Ensure you have Node.js version 18 or greater installed on your computer. You
can check your version of Node.js by running `node --version` in your terminal.
If you don't have the appropriate version of Node.js installed,
[install it from the Node.js website.](https://nodejs.org/en)

In addition, this walkthrough requires Git, so verify you have it installed by
running `git -v` in your terminal. If not, head over to the
[Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for
installation instructions.

First, clone the example project repo from GitHub and install the dependencies:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
git clone https://github.com/get-convex/convex-tutorial.git
cd convex-tutorial
npm install

```

This app's `dev` npm command sets up Convex and then runs the web app:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm run dev

```

During setup, you'll see that Convex uses your GitHub account for
authentication. Sign into Convex with GitHub and then accept the default project
setup prompts.

This will **automatically create your backend** and a folder called `convex/` in
your project, where you'll write your backend code.

**Make sure you keep this command ( `npm run dev`) running in the background**
**throughout this tutorial.** It's running both the dev web server for the
frontend as well as the `convex` command in the background to keep your backend
in sync with your local codebase.

Once your server is up and running, open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)
and check it out:

![Chat UI](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/tut_chat_ui-9ab95f331e3132c9c61a0e2fc4eaf16c.png)

If you try sending a message now, you'll see an alert telling you the mutation
is not yet implemented. We'll do that in a bit, but first here's a quick summary
of how Convex works.

## How Convex works [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial\\#how-convex-works \"Direct link to How Convex works\")

![Overview of the sync engine](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/ConvexSyncEngine-3271d28868180073da72479d72a5d93e.png)

**Database.** The Convex database is a document-relational database, which means
you have tables with JSON like documents in them. All documents have an
auto-generated `_id` that can be used to create relations between documents. You
interact with the database through mutation and query functions that are written
entirely in TypeScript.

**Mutation functions.** Mutations are TypeScript functions that update the
database. All mutation functions in Convex run as a database transaction. So
either all the changes are committed, or none are.

**Query functions.** Queries are TypeScript functions that can only read from
the database. As we'll see in a bit, you subscribe to them from your frontend to
keep your app automatically up to date.

Your frontend registers to listen to query updates through the **client**
**library**. The client libraries talk to Convex via WebSockets for fast realtime
updates.

The **sync engine** reruns query functions when any input to the function
changes, including any changes to the documents in the database that the query
reads. It then updates every app listening to the query. The sync engine is the
combination of queries, mutations and the database.

Now, let's dive into the code!

## Your first `mutation` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial\\#your-first-mutation \"Direct link to your-first-mutation\")

Create a new file in your `convex/` folder called `chat.ts`. This is where
you'll write your Convex backend functions for this application.

**Add the following to your `convex/chat.ts` file.**

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const sendMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    user: v.string(),
    body: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    console.log(\"This TypeScript function is running on the server.\");
    await ctx.db.insert(\"messages\", {
      user: args.user,
      body: args.body,
    });
  },
});

```

Let's break this down:

1. You've added a new backend `mutation` function called `sendMessage` and
exposed it as a public api.
2. The whole function automatically runs as a transaction that will roll back if
an exception is thrown.
3. Since this is just a TypeScript function you can drop `console.log` lines to
do simple debugging on the server.
4. `args:` ensures the function arguments are two strings named `user` and
`body`, both as types and runtime values.
5. `ctx.db.insert` tells Convex to insert a new message document into the table.

Now, let's connect this mutation to your web app.

**Update your `src/App.tsx` file like so:**

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// Import `useMutation` and `api` from Convex.
import { useMutation } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

//...

export default function App() {
  // Replace the \"TODO: Add mutation hook here.\" with:
  const sendMessage = useMutation(api.chat.sendMessage);

  //...

  return (
    <main className=\"chat\">
      {/* ... */}
      <form
        onSubmit={async (e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          // Replace \"alert(\"Mutation not implemented yet\");\" with:
          await sendMessage({ user: NAME, body: newMessageText });

          setNewMessageText(\"\");
        }}
      >
        {/* ... */}
      </form>
    </main>
  );
}

```

There are two steps to call a mutation in your frontend:

1. `const sendMessage = useMutation(api.chat.sendMessage);` gives your frontend
app a handle to the mutation function
2. `await sendMessage({ user: NAME, body: newMessageText });` calls the mutation
with the proper parameters.

This is a good time to **open up the Convex dashboard**. Open a new browser
window and go to [https://dashboard.convex.dev](https://dashboard.convex.dev/)
and find new `convex-tutorial` project.

**Go to the \"Data\" screen**. So far, there is no data in your database.

**Keep your chat app and dashboard windows open side by side**. Now try to send
some messages from your chat app.

Mutations hooked up to the Convex backend and database.

You'll notice new chat messages showing up live in the `messages` table.

Convex automatically created a `messages` table when you sent the first message.
In Convex, [schemas](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) are optional. Eventually,
you'll want to enforce the structure of your tables, but for the purposes of the
tutorial we'll skip this.

In the dashboard you can also go to the
[logs screen](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/logs) and see every call
to the mutation as you ran with the log line we added earlier. The logs screen
is a critical part of debugging your backend in development.

You've successfully created a `mutation` function, which is also a database
transaction, and connected it to your UI.

Now, let's make sure your app can update live the same way the dashboard is
updating live.

## Your first `query` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial\\#your-first-query \"Direct link to your-first-query\")

**Update your `convex/chat.ts` file like this:**

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// Update your server import like this:
import { query, mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";

// ...

// Add the following function to the file:
export const getMessages = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    // Get most recent messages first
    const messages = await ctx.db.query(\"messages\").order(\"desc\").take(50);
    // Reverse the list so that it's in a chronological order.
    return messages.reverse();
  },
});

```

Let's break this down:

1. You've added a new backend `query` function called `getMessages` and exposed
it as a public api.
2. Since this is a query function, the `ctx.db` in this function only lets you
read data.
3. In the first line of the `handler` you are querying the most recent 50
messages from newest to oldest.
4. In the second line you're reversing the list using plain old TypeScript.

**Now update `src/App.tsx` to read from your query:**

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// Update your convex/react import like this:
import { useQuery, useMutation } from \"convex/react\";

//...

export default function App() {
  // Replace the `const messages = ...` line with the following
  const messages = useQuery(api.chat.getMessages);

  //...
}

```

That one `useQuery` line is doing a lot of work automatically for you. It's
telling the Convex client library to subscribe to your `getMessages` function.
Anytime there are new messages to show the query function is automatically
rerun. The result is put in `const messages` variable and React rerenders your
UI component to show the latest messages.

That's it. Now go back to your app and try sending messages.

Your app should be showing live updates as new messages arrive:

Queries hooked up and live updating to the app.

Don't believe it? Try opening two chat windows side by side and send some
messages:

Live syncing chat app.

## What you built [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial\\#what-you-built \"Direct link to What you built\")

With just a few lines of code you've built a live updating chat app.

1. You created a `mutation` TypeScript function that, in a transaction, adds new
chat messages to your database.
2. You created a `query` TypeScript function updates your app with the latest
data.
3. You used the client library that keeps your frontend in live sync with the
backend.

You've learned the fundamentals of Convex and the sync engine that powers
everything.

Convex React is the client library enabling your React application to interact
with your Convex backend. It allows your frontend code to:

1. Call your [queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions),
[mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) and
[actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions)
2. Upload and display files from [File Storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage)
3. Authenticate users using [Authentication](https://docs.convex.dev/auth)
4. Implement full text [Search](https://docs.convex.dev/search) over your data

The Convex React client is open source and available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-js).

Follow the [React Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/react) to get started with
React using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Installation [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#installation \"Direct link to Installation\")

Convex React is part of the `convex` npm package:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm install convex

```

## Connecting to a backend [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#connecting-to-a-backend \"Direct link to Connecting to a backend\")

The [`ConvexReactClient`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/react.ConvexReactClient) maintains a
connection to your Convex backend, and is used by the React hooks described
below to call your functions.

First you need to create an instance of the client by giving it your backend
deployment URL. See
[Configuring Deployment URL](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/deployment-urls) on how to pass
in the right value:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { ConvexProvider, ConvexReactClient } from \"convex/react\";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(\"https://<your domain here>.convex.cloud\");

```

And then you make the client available to your app by passing it in to a
[`ConvexProvider`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#convexprovider) wrapping your component
tree:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
reactDOMRoot.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ConvexProvider client={convex}>
      <App />
    </ConvexProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);

```

## Fetching data [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#fetching-data \"Direct link to Fetching data\")

Your React app fetches data using the [`useQuery`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#usequery)
React hook by calling your [queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) via an
[`api`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/api#api) object.

The `npx convex dev` command generates this api object for you in the
`convex/_generated/api.js` module to provide better autocompletion in JavaScript
and end-to-end type safety in
[TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/typescript):

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useQuery } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function App() {
  const data = useQuery(api.functions.myQuery);
  return data ?? \"Loading...\";
}

```

The `useQuery` hook returns `undefined` while the data is first loading and
afterwards the return value of your query.

### Query arguments [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#query-arguments \"Direct link to Query arguments\")

Arguments to your query follow the query name:

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export function App() {
  const a = \"Hello world\";
  const b = 4;
  const data = useQuery(api.functions.myQuery, { a, b });
  //...
}

```

### Reactivity [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#reactivity \"Direct link to Reactivity\")

The `useQuery` hook makes your app automatically reactive: when the underlying
data changes in your database, your component rerenders with the new query
result.

The first time the hook is used it creates a subscription to your backend for a
given query and any arguments you pass in. When your component unmounts, the
subscription is canceled.

### Consistency [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#consistency \"Direct link to Consistency\")

Convex React ensures that your application always renders a consistent view of
the query results based on a single state of the underlying database.

Imagine a mutation changes some data in the database, and that 2 different
`useQuery` call sites rely on this data. Your app will never render in an
inconsistent state where only one of the `useQuery` call sites reflects the new
data.

### Paginating queries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#paginating-queries \"Direct link to Paginating queries\")

See
[Paginating within React Components](https://docs.convex.dev/database/pagination#paginating-within-react-components).

### Skipping queries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#skipping-queries \"Direct link to Skipping queries\")

Advanced: Loading a query conditionally

With React it can be tricky to dynamically invoke a hook, because hooks cannot
be placed inside conditionals or after early returns:

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useQuery } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function App() {
  // the URL `param` might be null
  const param = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(\"param\");
  // ERROR! React Hook \"useQuery\" is called conditionally. React Hooks must
  // be called in the exact same order in every component render.
  const data = param !== null ? useQuery(api.functions.read, { param }) : null;
  //...
}

```

For this reason `useQuery` can be \"disabled\" by passing in `\"skip\"` instead of
its arguments:

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useQuery } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function App() {
  const param = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(\"param\");
  const data = useQuery(
    api.functions.read,
    param !== null ? { param } : \"skip\",
  );
  //...
}

```

When `\"skip\"` is used the `useQuery` doesn't talk to your backend at all and
returns `undefined`.

### One-off queries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#one-off-queries \"Direct link to One-off queries\")

Advanced: Fetching a query from a callback

Sometimes you might want to read state from the database in response to a user
action, for example to validate given input, without making any changes to the
database. In this case you can use a one-off
[`query`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/react.ConvexReactClient#query) call, similarly to calling
mutations and actions.

The async method `query` is exposed on the `ConvexReactClient`, which you can
reference in your components via the
[`useConvex()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#useconvex) hook.

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useConvex } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function App() {
  const convex = useConvex();
  return (
    <button
      onClick={async () => {
        console.log(await convex.query(api.functions.myQuery));
      }}
    >
      Check
    </button>
  );
}

```

## Editing data [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#editing-data \"Direct link to Editing data\")

Your React app edits data using the
[`useMutation`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#usemutation) React hook by calling your
[mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions).

The `convex dev` command generates this api object for you in the
`convex/_generated/api.js` module to provide better autocompletion in JavaScript
and end-to-end type safety in
[TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/typescript):

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useMutation } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function App() {
  const doSomething = useMutation(api.functions.doSomething);
  return <button onClick={() => doSomething()}>Click me</button>;
}

```

The hook returns an `async` function which performs the call to the mutation.

### Mutation arguments [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#mutation-arguments \"Direct link to Mutation arguments\")

Arguments to your mutation are passed to the `async` function returned from
`useMutation`:

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export function App() {
  const a = \"Hello world\";
  const b = 4;
  const doSomething = useMutation(api.functions.doSomething);
  return <button onClick={() => doSomething({ a, b })}>Click me</button>;
}

```

### Mutation response and error handling [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#mutation-response-and-error-handling \"Direct link to Mutation response and error handling\")

The mutation can optionally return a value or throw errors, which you can
[`await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await):

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export function App() {
  const doSomething = useMutation(api.functions.doSomething);
  const onClick = () => {
    async function callBackend() {
      try {
        const result = await doSomething();
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
      }
      console.log(result);
    }
    void callBackend();
  };
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
}

```

Or handle as a
[`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise):

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export function App() {
  const doSomething = useMutation(api.functions.doSomething);
  const onClick = () => {
    doSomething()
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
      })
      .then((result) => {
        console.log(result);
      });
  };
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;
}

```

Learn more about
[Error Handling](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/) in
functions.

### Retries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#retries \"Direct link to Retries\")

Convex React automatically retries mutations until they are confirmed to have
been written to the database. The Convex backend ensures that despite multiple
retries, every mutation call only executes once.

Additionally, Convex React will warn users if they try to close their browser
tab while there are outstanding mutations. This means that when you call a
Convex mutation, you can be sure that the user's edits won't be lost.

### Optimistic updates [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#optimistic-updates \"Direct link to Optimistic updates\")

Convex queries are fully reactive, so all query results will be automatically
updated after a mutation. Sometimes you may want to update the UI before the
mutation changes propagate back to the client. To accomplish this, you can
configure an _optimistic update_ to execute as part of your mutation.

Optimistic updates are temporary, local changes to your query results which are
used to make your app more responsive.

See [Optimistic Updates](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/optimistic-updates) on how to
configure them.

## Calling third-party APIs [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#calling-third-party-apis \"Direct link to Calling third-party APIs\")

Your React app can read data, call third-party services, and write data with a
single backend call using the [`useAction`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#useaction) React
hook by calling your [actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions).

Like `useQuery` and `useMutation`, this hook is used with the `api` object
generated for you in the `convex/_generated/api.js` module to provide better
autocompletion in JavaScript and end-to-end type safety in
[TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/typescript):

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useAction } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function App() {
  const doSomeAction = useAction(api.functions.doSomeAction);
  return <button onClick={() => doSomeAction()}>Click me</button>;
}

```

The hook returns an `async` function which performs the call to the action.

### Action arguments [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#action-arguments \"Direct link to Action arguments\")

Action arguments work exactly the same as
[mutation arguments](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#mutation-arguments).

### Action response and error handling [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#action-response-and-error-handling \"Direct link to Action response and error handling\")

Action response and error handling work exactly the same as
[mutation response and error handling](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#mutation-response-and-error-handling).

Actions do not support automatic retries or optimistic updates.

## Under the hood [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react\\#under-the-hood \"Direct link to Under the hood\")

The [`ConvexReactClient`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/react.ConvexReactClient) connects to your
Convex deployment by creating a
[`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket). The
WebSocket provides a 2-way communication channel over TCP. This allows Convex to
push new query results reactively to the client without the client needing to
poll for updates.

If the internet connection drops, the client will handle reconnecting and
re-establishing the Convex session automatically.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is an authentication platform providing login via
passwords, social identity providers, one-time email or SMS access codes,
multi-factor authentication, and single sign on and basic user management.

**Example:** [Convex Authentication with Auth0](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/users-and-auth)

If you're using Next.js see the
[Next.js setup guide](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs).

## Get started [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0\\#get-started \"Direct link to Get started\")

This guide assumes you already have a working React app with Convex. If not
follow the [Convex React Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/react) first. Then:

1. Follow the Auth0 React quickstart



Follow the [Auth0 React Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/interactive).



Sign up for a free Auth0 account.



Configure your application, using `http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:5173` for Callback
and Logout URLs and Allowed Web Origins.



Come back when you finish the _Install the Auth0 React SDK_ step.







![Sign up to Auth0](https://docs.convex.dev/screenshots/auth0-signup.png)

2. Create the auth config



In the `convex` folder create a new file `auth.config.ts` with
the server-side configuration for validating access tokens.



Paste in the `domain` and `clientId` values shown in
_Install the Auth0 React SDK_ step of the Auth0 quickstart or
in your Auth0 application's Settings dashboard.













convex/auth.config.ts







TS

















```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export default {
     providers: [\\
       {\\
         domain: \"your-domain.us.auth0.com\",\\
         applicationID: \"yourclientid\",\\
       },\\
     ]
};

```

3. Deploy your changes



Run `npx convex dev` to automatically sync your configuration to your backend.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dev

```

4. Configure ConvexProviderWithAuth0



Now replace your `ConvexProvider` with an `Auth0Provider` wrapping `ConvexProviderWithAuth0`.
Add the `domain` and `clientId` as props to the `Auth0Provider`.



Paste in the `domain` and `clientId` values shown in
_Install the Auth0 React SDK_ step of the Auth0 quickstart or
in your Auth0 application's Settings dashboard as props to `Auth0Provider`.













src/main.tsx







TS

















```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import React from \"react\";
import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";
import App from \"./App\";
import \"./index.css\";
import { ConvexReactClient } from \"convex/react\";
import { ConvexProviderWithAuth0 } from \"convex/react-auth0\";
import { Auth0Provider } from \"@auth0/auth0-react\";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL as string);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\")!).render(
     <React.StrictMode>
       <Auth0Provider
         domain=\"your-domain.us.auth0.com\"
         clientId=\"yourclientid\"
         authorizationParams={{
           redirect_uri: window.location.origin,
         }}
         useRefreshTokens={true}
         cacheLocation=\"localstorage\"
       >
         <ConvexProviderWithAuth0 client={convex}>
           <App />
         </ConvexProviderWithAuth0>
       </Auth0Provider>
     </React.StrictMode>,
);

```


## Login and logout flows [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0\\#login-and-logout-flows \"Direct link to Login and logout flows\")

Now that you have everything set up, you can use the
[`useAuth0()`](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-react/functions/useAuth0.html) hook
to create login and logout buttons for your app.

The login button will redirect the user to the Auth0 universal login page. For
details see
[Add Login to Your Application](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/interactive#add-login-to-your-application)
in the Auth0 React Quickstart.

src/login.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useAuth0 } from \"@auth0/auth0-react\";

export default function LoginButton() {
  const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0();
  return <button onClick={loginWithRedirect}>Log in</button>;
}

```

The logout button will redirect the user to the Auth0 logout endpoint. For
details see
[Add Logout to your Application](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/interactive#add-logout-to-your-application)
in the Auth0 React Quickstart.

src/logout.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useAuth0 } from \"@auth0/auth0-react\";

export default function LogoutButton() {
  const { logout } = useAuth0();
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() =>
        logout({ logoutParams: { returnTo: window.location.origin } })
      }
    >
      Log out
    </button>
  );
}

```

## Logged-in and logged-out views [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0\\#logged-in-and-logged-out-views \"Direct link to Logged-in and logged-out views\")

Use the [`useConvexAuth()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#useconvexauth) hook instead of
the `useAuth0` hook when you need to check whether the user is logged in or not.
The `useConvex` hook makes sure that the browser has fetched the auth token
needed to make authenticated requests to your Convex backend:

src/App.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useConvexAuth } from \"convex/react\";

function App() {
  const { isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useConvexAuth();

  return (
    <div className=\"App\">
      {isAuthenticated ? \"Logged in\" : \"Logged out or still loading\"}
    </div>
  );
}

```

You can also use the `Authenticated`, `Unauthenticated` and `AuthLoading` helper
components which use the `useConvexAuth` hook under the hood:

src/App.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { Authenticated, Unauthenticated, AuthLoading } from \"convex/react\";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className=\"App\">
      <Authenticated>Logged in</Authenticated>
      <Unauthenticated>Logged out</Unauthenticated>
      <AuthLoading>Still loading</AuthLoading>
    </div>
  );
}

```

## User information in React [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0\\#user-information-in-react \"Direct link to User information in React\")

You can access information about the authenticated user like their name from the
`useAuth0` hook:

src/badge.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useAuth0 } from \"@auth0/auth0-react\";

export default function Badge() {
  const { user } = useAuth0();
  return <span>Logged in as {user.name}</span>;
}

```

## User information in functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0\\#user-information-in-functions \"Direct link to User information in functions\")

See [Auth in Functions](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/functions-auth) to learn about how to
access information about the authenticated user in your queries, mutations and
actions.

See [Storing Users in the Convex Database](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth) to
learn about how to store user information in the Convex database.

## Configuring dev and prod tenants [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0\\#configuring-dev-and-prod-tenants \"Direct link to Configuring dev and prod tenants\")

To configure a different Auth0 tenant (environment) between your Convex
development and production deployments you can use environment variables
configured on the Convex dashboard.

### Configuring the backend [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0\\#configuring-the-backend \"Direct link to Configuring the backend\")

First, change your `auth.config.ts` file to use
environment variables:

convex/auth.config.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export default {
  providers: [\\
    {\\
      domain: process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN,\\
      applicationID: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,\\
    },\\
  ],
};

```

**Development configuration**

Open the Settings for your dev deployment on the Convex
[dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/) and add the variables there:

![Convex dashboard dev deployment settings](https://docs.convex.dev/screenshots/auth0-convex-dashboard.png)

Now switch to the new configuration by running `npx convex dev`.

**Production configuration**

Similarly on the Convex [dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/) switch to your
production deployment in the left side menu and set the values for your
production Auth0 tenant there.

Now switch to the new configuration by running `npx convex deploy`.

### Configuring a React client [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0\\#configuring-a-react-client \"Direct link to Configuring a React client\")

To configure your client you can use environment variables as well. The exact
name of the environment variables and the way to refer to them depends on each
client platform (Vite vs Next.js etc.), refer to our corresponding
[Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstarts) or the relevant documentation for the
platform you're using.

Change the props to `Auth0Provider` to take in environment variables:

src/main.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import React from \"react\";
import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";
import App from \"./App\";
import \"./index.css\";
import { ConvexReactClient } from \"convex/react\";
import { ConvexProviderWithAuth0 } from \"convex/react-auth0\";
import { Auth0Provider } from \"@auth0/auth0-react\";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL as string);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Auth0Provider
      domain={import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN}
      clientId={import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}
      authorizationParams={{
        redirect_uri: window.location.origin,
      }}
      useRefreshTokens={true}
      cacheLocation=\"localstorage\"
    >
      <ConvexProviderWithAuth0 client={convex}>
        <App />
      </ConvexProviderWithAuth0>
    </Auth0Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);

```

**Development configuration**

Use the `.env.local` or `.env` file to configure your client when running
locally. The name of the environment variables file depends on each client
platform (Vite vs Next.js etc.), refer to our corresponding
[Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstarts) or the relevant documentation for the
platform you're using:

.env.local

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=\"your-domain.us.auth0.com\"
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=\"yourclientid\"

```

**Production configuration**

Set the environment variables in your production environment depending on your
hosting platform. See [Hosting](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/).

## Debugging authentication [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0\\#debugging-authentication \"Direct link to Debugging authentication\")

If a user goes through the Auth0 login flow successfully, and after being
redirected back to your page `useConvexAuth` gives `isAuthenticated: false`,
it's possible that your backend isn't correctly configured.

The `auth.config.ts` file in your `convex/` directory
contains a list of configured authentication providers. You must run
`npx convex dev` or `npx convex deploy` after adding a new provider to sync the
configuration to your backend.

For more thorough debugging steps, see
[Debugging Authentication](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug).

## Under the hood [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0\\#under-the-hood \"Direct link to Under the hood\")

The authentication flow looks like this under the hood:

1. The user clicks a login button
2. The user is redirected to a page where they log in via whatever method you
configure in Auth0
3. After a successful login Auth0 redirects back to your page, or a
different page which you configure via the [`authorizationParams`](https://auth0.github.io/auth0-react/interfaces/AuthorizationParams.html) prop.
4. The `Auth0Provider` now knows that the user is authenticated.
5. The `ConvexProviderWithAuth0` fetches an auth token from Auth0.
6. The `ConvexReactClient` passes this token down to your Convex backend to
validate
7. Your Convex backend retrieves the public key from Auth0 to check
that the token's signature is valid.
8. The `ConvexReactClient` is notified of successful authentication, and
`ConvexProviderWithAuth0` now knows that the user is authenticated with
Convex. `useConvexAuth` returns `isAuthenticated: true` and the
`Authenticated` component renders its children.

`ConvexProviderWithAuth0` takes care of refetching the token when needed to
make sure the user stays authenticated with your backend.

    ![Create a Clerk application](https://docs.convex.dev/screenshots/clerk-createapp.png)

03. Create a JWT Template



    In the JWT Templates section of the Clerk dashboard tap on
    _+ New template_ and choose **Convex**



    Copy the _Issuer_ URL from the Issuer input field.



    Hit _Apply Changes_.



    Note: Do NOT rename the JWT token, it must be called `convex`.







    ![Create a JWT template](https://docs.convex.dev/screenshots/clerk-createjwt.png)

04. Create the auth config



    In the `convex` folder create a new file `auth.config.ts` with
    the server-side configuration for validating access tokens.



    Paste in the _Issuer_ URL from the JWT template and set `applicationID` to `\"convex\"` (the value
    of the `\"aud\"` _Claims_ field).













    convex/auth.config.ts







    TS

















    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    export default {
      providers: [\\
        {\\
          domain: \"https://your-issuer-url.clerk.accounts.dev/\",\\
          applicationID: \"convex\",\\
        },\\
      ]
    };

    ```

05. Deploy your changes



    Run `npx convex dev` to automatically sync your configuration to your backend.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex dev

    ```

06. Install clerk



    In a new terminal window, install the Clerk React library











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npm install @clerk/clerk-react

    ```

07. Get your Clerk Publishable key



    On the Clerk dashboard in the API Keys section copy the Publishable key







    ![Clerk publishable key setting](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/clerk-pkey-da3c2fc00a2f4fbb8e726b139f023531.png)

08. Configure ConvexProviderWithClerk



    Now replace your `ConvexProvider` with `ClerkProvider` wrapping
    `ConvexProviderWithClerk`.



    Pass the Clerk `useAuth` hook to the `ConvexProviderWithClerk`.



    Paste the Publishable key as a prop to `ClerkProvider`.













    src/main.tsx







    TS

















    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import React from \"react\";
    import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";
    import App from \"./App\";
    import \"./index.css\";
    import { ClerkProvider, useAuth } from \"@clerk/clerk-react\";
    import { ConvexProviderWithClerk } from \"convex/react-clerk\";
    import { ConvexReactClient } from \"convex/react\";

    const convex = new ConvexReactClient(import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL as string);

    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\")!).render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <ClerkProvider publishableKey=\"pk_test_...\">
          <ConvexProviderWithClerk client={convex} useAuth={useAuth}>
            <App />
          </ConvexProviderWithClerk>
        </ClerkProvider>
      </React.StrictMode>,
    );

    ```

09. Show UI based on authentication state



    You can control which UI is shown when the user is signed in or signed out
    with the provided components from `\"convex/react\"` and `\"@clerk/clerk-react\"`.



    To get started create a shell that will let the user sign in and sign out.



    Because the `Content` component is a child of `Authenticated`, within it and
    any of its children authentication is guaranteed and Convex queries can
    require it.













    src/App.tsx







    TS

















    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { SignInButton, UserButton } from \"@clerk/clerk-react\";
    import { Authenticated, Unauthenticated, useQuery } from \"convex/react\";
    import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

    function App() {
      return (
        <main>
          <Unauthenticated>
            <SignInButton />
          </Unauthenticated>
          <Authenticated>
            <UserButton />
            <Content />
          </Authenticated>
        </main>
      );
    }

    function Content() {
      const messages = useQuery(api.messages.getForCurrentUser);
      return <div>Authenticated content: {messages?.length}</div>;
    }

    export default App;

    ```

10. Use authentication state in your Convex functions



    If the client is authenticated, you can access the information
    stored in the JWT via `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity`.



    If the client isn't authenticated, `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity` will return `null`.



    **Make sure that the component calling this query is a child of `Authenticated` from**
    **`\"convex/react\"`**, otherwise it will throw on page load.













    convex/messages.ts







    TS

















    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

    export const getForCurrentUser = query({
      args: {},
      handler: async (ctx) => {
        const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
        if (identity === null) {
          throw new Error(\"Not authenticated\");
        }
        return await ctx.db
          .query(\"messages\")
          .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field(\"author\"), identity.email))
          .collect();
      },
    });

    ```


## Login and logout Flows [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk\\#login-and-logout-flows \"Direct link to Login and logout Flows\")

Now that you have everything set up, you can use the
[`SignInButton`](https://clerk.com/docs/components/authentication/sign-in)
component to create a login flow for your app.

The login button will open the Clerk configured login dialog:

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { SignInButton } from \"@clerk/clerk-react\";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className=\"App\">
      <SignInButton mode=\"modal\" />
    </div>
  );
}

```

To enable a logout flow you can use the
[`SignOutButton`](https://clerk.com/docs/components/unstyled/sign-out-button) or
the [`UserButton`](https://clerk.com/docs/components/user/user-button) which
opens a dialog that includes a sign out button.

## Logged-in and logged-out views [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk\\#logged-in-and-logged-out-views \"Direct link to Logged-in and logged-out views\")

Use the [`useConvexAuth()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#useconvexauth) hook instead of
Clerk's `useAuth` hook when you need to check whether the user is logged in or
not. The `useConvexAuth` hook makes sure that the browser has fetched the auth
token needed to make authenticated requests to your Convex backend, and that the
Convex backend has validated it:

src/App.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useConvexAuth } from \"convex/react\";

function App() {
  const { isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useConvexAuth();

  return (
    <div className=\"App\">
      {isAuthenticated ? \"Logged in\" : \"Logged out or still loading\"}
    </div>
  );
}

```

You can also use the `Authenticated`, `Unauthenticated` and `AuthLoading` helper
components instead of the similarly named Clerk components. These components use
the `useConvex` hook under the hood:

src/App.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { Authenticated, Unauthenticated, AuthLoading } from \"convex/react\";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className=\"App\">
      <Authenticated>Logged in</Authenticated>
      <Unauthenticated>Logged out</Unauthenticated>
      <AuthLoading>Still loading</AuthLoading>
    </div>
  );
}

```

## User information in functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk\\#user-information-in-functions \"Direct link to User information in functions\")

See [Auth in Functions](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/functions-auth) to learn about how to
access information about the authenticated user in your queries, mutations and
actions.

See [Storing Users in the Convex Database](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth) to
learn about how to store user information in the Convex database.

## User information in React [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk\\#user-information-in-react \"Direct link to User information in React\")

You can access information about the authenticated user like their name from
Clerk's [`useUser`](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/clerk-react/useuser) hook.
See the [User doc](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/clerkjs/user) for the list
of available fields:

src/badge.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useUser } from \"@clerk/clerk-react\";

export default function Badge() {
  const { user } = useUser();
  return <span>Logged in as {user.fullName}</span>;
}

```

## Next.js, React Native Expo, Gatsby [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk\\#nextjs-react-native-expo-gatsby \"Direct link to Next.js, React Native Expo, Gatsby\")

The `ConvexProviderWithClerk` component supports all Clerk integrations based on
the `@clerk/clerk-react` library. Replace the package from which you import the
`ClerkProvider` component and follow any additional steps in Clerk docs.

## Configuring dev and prod instances [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk\\#configuring-dev-and-prod-instances \"Direct link to Configuring dev and prod instances\")

To configure a different Clerk instance between your Convex development and
production deployments you can use environment variables configured on the
Convex dashboard.

### Configuring the backend [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk\\#configuring-the-backend \"Direct link to Configuring the backend\")

First, change your `auth.config.ts` file to use an
environment variable:

convex/auth.config.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export default {
  providers: [\\
    {\\
      domain: process.env.CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN,\\
      applicationID: \"convex\",\\
    },\\
  ],
};

```

**Development configuration**

Open the Settings for your dev deployment on the Convex
[dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/) and add the variables there:

![Convex dashboard dev deployment settings](https://docs.convex.dev/screenshots/clerk-convex-dashboard.png)

Now switch to the new configuration by running `npx convex dev`.

**Production configuration**

Similarly on the Convex [dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/) switch to your
production deployment in the left side menu and set the values for your
production Clerk instance there.

Now switch to the new configuration by running `npx convex deploy`.

### Configuring a React client [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk\\#configuring-a-react-client \"Direct link to Configuring a React client\")

To configure your client you can use environment variables as well. The exact
name of the environment variables and the way to refer to them depends on each
client platform (Vite vs Next.js etc.), refer to our corresponding
[Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstarts) or the relevant documentation for the
platform you're using.

Change the props to `ClerkProvider` to take in an environment variable:

src/main.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import React from \"react\";
import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";
import App from \"./App\";
import \"./index.css\";
import { ClerkProvider, useAuth } from \"@clerk/clerk-react\";
import { ConvexProviderWithClerk } from \"convex/react-clerk\";
import { ConvexReactClient } from \"convex/react\";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL as string);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\")!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
      <ConvexProviderWithClerk client={convex} useAuth={useAuth}>
        <App />
      </ConvexProviderWithClerk>
    </ClerkProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
);

```

**Development configuration**

Use the `.env.local` or `.env` file to configure your client when running
locally. The name of the environment variables file depends on each client
platform (Vite vs Next.js etc.), refer to our corresponding
[Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstarts) or the relevant documentation for the
platform you're using:

.env.local

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=\"pk_test_...\"

```

**Production configuration**

Set the environment variable in your production environment depending on your
hosting platform. See [Hosting](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/).

## Debugging authentication [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk\\#debugging-authentication \"Direct link to Debugging authentication\")

If a user goes through the Clerk login flow successfully, and after being
redirected back to your page `useConvexAuth` gives `isAuthenticated: false`,
it's possible that your backend isn't correctly configured.

The `auth.config.ts` file in your `convex/` directory
contains a list of configured authentication providers. You must run
`npx convex dev` or `npx convex deploy` after adding a new provider to sync the
configuration to your backend.

For more thorough debugging steps, see
[Debugging Authentication](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug).

## Under the hood [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk\\#under-the-hood \"Direct link to Under the hood\")

The authentication flow looks like this under the hood:

1. The user clicks a login button
2. The user is redirected to a page where they log in via whatever method you
configure in Clerk
3. After a successful login Clerk redirects back to your page, or a
different page which you configure via the [`afterSignIn`](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/sign-in#override-ur-ls) prop.
4. The `ClerkProvider` now knows that the user is authenticated.
5. The `ConvexProviderWithClerk` fetches an auth token from Clerk.
6. The `ConvexReactClient` passes this token down to your Convex backend to
validate
7. Your Convex backend retrieves the public key from Clerk to check
that the token's signature is valid.
8. The `ConvexReactClient` is notified of successful authentication, and
`ConvexProviderWithClerk` now knows that the user is authenticated with
Convex. `useConvexAuth` returns `isAuthenticated: true` and the
`Authenticated` component renders its children.

`ConvexProviderWithClerk` takes care of refetching the token when needed to
make sure the user stays authenticated with your backend.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

Queries are the bread and butter of your backend API. They fetch data from the
database, check authentication or perform other business logic, and return data
back to the client application.

This is an example query, taking in named arguments, reading data from the
database and returning a result:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

// Return the last 100 tasks in a given task list.
export const getTaskList = query({
  args: { taskListId: v.id(\"taskLists\") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const tasks = await ctx.db
      .query(\"tasks\")
      .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field(\"taskListId\"), args.taskListId))
      .order(\"desc\")
      .take(100);
    return tasks;
  },
});

```

Read on to understand how to build queries yourself.

## Query names [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions\\#query-names \"Direct link to Query names\")

Queries are defined in

TypeScript

files inside your `convex/`
directory.

The path and name of the file, as well as the way the function is exported from
the file, determine the name the client will use to call it:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// This function will be referred to as `api.myFunctions.myQuery`.
export const myQuery = …;

// This function will be referred to as `api.myFunctions.sum`.
export const sum = …;

```

To structure your API you can nest directories inside the `convex/` directory:

convex/foo/myQueries.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// This function will be referred to as `api.foo.myQueries.listMessages`.
export const listMessages = …;

```

Default exports receive the name `default`.

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// This function will be referred to as `api.myFunctions.default`.
export default …;

```

The same rules apply to [mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) and
[actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions), while
[HTTP actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions) use a different routing
approach.

Client libraries in languages other than JavaScript and TypeScript use strings
instead of API objects:

- `api.myFunctions.myQuery` is `\"myFunctions:myQuery\"`
- `api.foo.myQueries.myQuery` is `\"foo/myQueries:myQuery\"`.
- `api.myFunction.default` is `\"myFunction:default\"` or `\"myFunction\"`.

## The `query` constructor [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions\\#the-query-constructor \"Direct link to the-query-constructor\")

To actually declare a query in Convex you use the `query` constructor function.
Pass it an object with a `handler` function, which returns the query result:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const myConstantString = query({
  handler: () => {
    return \"My never changing string\";
  },
});

```

### Query arguments [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions\\#query-arguments \"Direct link to Query arguments\")

Queries accept named arguments. The argument values are accessible as fields of
the second parameter of the handler function:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const sum = query({
  handler: (_, args: { a: number; b: number }) => {
    return args.a + args.b;
  },
});

```

Arguments and responses are automatically serialized and deserialized, and you
can pass and return most value-like JavaScript data to and from your query.

To both declare the types of arguments and to validate them, add an `args`
object using `v` validators:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const sum = query({
  args: { a: v.number(), b: v.number() },
  handler: (_, args) => {
    return args.a + args.b;
  },
});

```

See [argument validation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation) for the full list of
supported types and validators.

The first parameter of the handler function contains the query context.

### Query responses [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions\\#query-responses \"Direct link to Query responses\")

Queries can return values of any supported
[Convex type](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation) which will be automatically
serialized and deserialized.

Queries can also return `undefined`, which is not a valid Convex value. When a
query returns `undefined` **it is translated to `null`** on the client.

### Query context [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions\\#query-context \"Direct link to Query context\")

The `query` constructor enables fetching data, and other Convex features by
passing a [QueryCtx](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server#queryctx) object to the
handler function as the first parameter:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const myQuery = query({
  args: { a: v.number(), b: v.number() },
  handler: (ctx, args) => {
    // Do something with `ctx`
  },
});

```

Which part of the query context is used depends on what your query needs to do:

- To fetch from the database use the `db` field. Note that we make the handler
function an `async` function so we can `await` the promise returned by
`db.get()`:







convex/myFunctions.ts







TS

















```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const getTask = query({
    args: { id: v.id(\"tasks\") },
    handler: async (ctx, args) => {
      return await ctx.db.get(args.id);
    },
});

```









Read more about [Reading Data](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/).

- To return URLs to stored files use the `storage` field. Read more about
[File Storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage).

- To check user authentication use the `auth` field. Read more about
[Authentication](https://docs.convex.dev/auth).


## Splitting up query code via helpers [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions\\#splitting-up-query-code-via-helpers \"Direct link to Splitting up query code via helpers\")

When you want to split up the code in your query or reuse logic across multiple
Convex functions you can define and call helper

TypeScript

functions:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { Id } from \"./_generated/dataModel\";
import { query, QueryCtx } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const getTaskAndAuthor = query({
  args: { id: v.id(\"tasks\") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const task = await ctx.db.get(args.id);
    if (task === null) {
      return null;
    }
    return { task, author: await getUserName(ctx, task.authorId ?? null) };
  },
});

async function getUserName(ctx: QueryCtx, userId: Id<\"users\"> | null) {
  if (userId === null) {
    return null;
  }
  return (await ctx.db.get(userId))?.name;
}

```

You can `export` helpers to use them across multiple files. They will not be
callable from outside of your Convex functions.

See
[Type annotating server side helpers](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/typescript#type-annotating-server-side-helpers)
for more guidance on TypeScript types.

## Using NPM packages [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions\\#using-npm-packages \"Direct link to Using NPM packages\")

Queries can import NPM packages installed in `node_modules`. Not all NPM
packages are supported, see
[Runtimes](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#default-convex-runtime) for more
details.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm install @faker-js/faker

```

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { faker } from \"@faker-js/faker\";

export const randomName = query({
  args: {},
  handler: () => {
    faker.seed();
    return faker.person.fullName();
  },
});

```

## Calling queries from clients [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions\\#calling-queries-from-clients \"Direct link to Calling queries from clients\")

To call a query from [React](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react) use the
[`useQuery`](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#loading-data) hook along with the generated
[`api`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/api) object.

src/MyApp.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useQuery } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function MyApp() {
  const data = useQuery(api.myFunctions.sum, { a: 1, b: 2 });
  // do something with `data`
}

```

See the [React](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react) client documentation for all the ways
queries can be called.

## Caching & reactivity & consistency [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions\\#caching--reactivity--consistency \"Direct link to Caching & reactivity & consistency\")

Queries have three awesome attributes:

1. **Caching**: Convex caches query results automatically. If many clients
request the same query, with the same arguments, they will receive a cached
response.
2. **Reactivity**: clients can subscribe to queries to receive new results when
the underlying data changes.
3. **Consistency**: All database reads inside a single query call are performed
at the same logical timestamp. Concurrent writes do not affect the query
results.

To have these attributes the handler function must be _deterministic_, which
means that given the same arguments (including the query context) it will return
the same response.

For this reason queries cannot `fetch` from third party APIs. To call third
party APIs, use [actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions).

You might wonder whether you can use non-deterministic language functionality
like `Math.random()` or `Date.now()`. The short answer is that Convex takes care
of implementing these in a way that you don't have to think about the
deterministic constraint.

See [Runtimes](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#default-convex-runtime) for more
details on the Convex runtime.

## Limits [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions\\#limits \"Direct link to Limits\")

Queries have a limit to the amount of data they can read at once to guarantee
good performance. Check out these limits
[here](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/#database-limitations).

For information on other limits, see [here](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#default-convex-runtime).

Helpers for integrating Convex into Next.js applications using server rendering.

This module contains:

1. [preloadQuery](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/nextjs#preloadquery), for preloading data for reactive client components.
2. [fetchQuery](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/nextjs#fetchquery), [fetchMutation](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/nextjs#fetchmutation) and [fetchAction](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/nextjs#fetchaction) for loading and mutating Convex data
from Next.js Server Components, Server Actions and Route Handlers.

## Usage [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/nextjs\\#usage \"Direct link to Usage\")

All exported functions assume that a Convex deployment URL is set in the
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` environment variable. `npx convex dev` will
automatically set it during local development.

### Preloading data [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/nextjs\\#preloading-data \"Direct link to Preloading data\")

Preload data inside a Server Component:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { preloadQuery } from \"convex/nextjs\";
import { api } from \"@/convex/_generated/api\";
import ClientComponent from \"./ClientComponent\";

export async function ServerComponent() {
  const preloaded = await preloadQuery(api.foo.baz);
  return <ClientComponent preloaded={preloaded} />;
}

```

And pass it to a Client Component:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { Preloaded, usePreloadedQuery } from \"convex/nextjs\";
import { api } from \"@/convex/_generated/api\";

export function ClientComponent(props: {
  preloaded: Preloaded<typeof api.foo.baz>;
}) {
  const data = await usePreloadedQuery(props.preloaded);
  // render `data`...
}

```

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/react-native#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

Learn how to query data from Convex in a React Native app.

01. Create a React Native app



    Create a React Native app using the `npx create-expo-app` command.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx create-expo-app my-app

    ```

02. Install the Convex client and server library



    To get started, install the `convex`
    package which provides a convenient interface for working
    with Convex from a React app.



    Navigate to your app and install `convex`.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    cd my-app && npm install convex

    ```

03. Set up a Convex dev deployment



    Next, run `npx convex dev`. This
    will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
    create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.



    It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
    to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
    will then continue running to sync your functions
    with your dev deployment in the cloud.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex dev

    ```

04. Create sample data for your database



    Create a `sampleData.jsonl`
    file with some sample data.









    sampleData.jsonl





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    {\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

    ```

05. Add the sample data to your database



    Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table with the sample data into
    your Convex database with the `import` command.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

    ```

06. Expose a database query



    Add a new file `tasks.ts` in the `convex/` folder
    with a query function that loads the data.



    Exporting a query function from this file
    declares an API function named after the file
    and the export name, `api.tasks.get`.









    convex/tasks.ts





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

    export const get = query({
      args: {},
      handler: async (ctx) => {
        return await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
      },
    });

    ```

07. Reset the Expo project



    If you haven't done so yet, reset the Expo project to get a fresh
    `app` directory.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npm run reset-project

    ```

08. Connect the app to your backend



    In `_layout.tsx`, create a `ConvexReactClient` and pass it to a `ConvexProvider`
    wrapping your component tree.









    app/\\_layout.tsx





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { ConvexProvider, ConvexReactClient } from \"convex/react\";
    import { Stack } from \"expo-router\";

    const convex = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL!, {
      unsavedChangesWarning: false,
    });

    export default function RootLayout() {
      return (
        <ConvexProvider client={convex}>
          <Stack>
            <Stack.Screen name=\"index\" />
          </Stack>
        </ConvexProvider>
      );
    }

    ```

09. Display the data in your app



    In `index.tsx` use the `useQuery` hook to fetch
    from your `api.tasks.get` API.









    app/index.tsx





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { api } from \"@/convex/_generated/api\";
    import { useQuery } from \"convex/react\";
    import { Text, View } from \"react-native\";

    export default function Index() {
      const tasks = useQuery(api.tasks.get);
      return (
        <View
          style={{
            flex: 1,
            justifyContent: \"center\",
            alignItems: \"center\",
          }}
        >
          {tasks?.map(({ _id, text }) => <Text key={_id}>{text}</Text>)}
        </View>
      );
    }

    ```

10. Start the app



    Start the app, scan the provided QR code with your phone,
    and see the serialized list of tasks in the center of the screen.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npm start

    ```


Are you trying to build a universal app targeting both browsers and mobile
devices? Use `npm create tamagui` and apply the steps above to the `apps/expo`
directory and the steps in the [Next.js Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/nextjs)
to the `apps/next` directory.

On this page

Alternatively to [`convex-test`](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test) you can test
your functions using the
[open-source version of the Convex backend](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-backend).

## Getting Started [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-backend\\#getting-started \"Direct link to Getting Started\")

Follow [this guide](https://stack.convex.dev/testing-with-local-oss-backend) for
the instructions.

Compared to `convex-test`, which uses a JS mock of the backend, running your
tests against the real backend has these advantages:

- Your tests will run against the same code as your Convex production (as long
you keep the local backend up-to-date).
- Limits on argument, data, query sizes are enforced.
- You can bootstrap a large test dataset from a data import.
- You can test your client code in combination with your backend logic.

## Limitations [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-backend\\#limitations \"Direct link to Limitations\")

Note that testing against the local backend also has some drawbacks:

- It requires setting up the local backend, which is more involved.
- No control over time and any scheduled functions will run as scheduled.
- Crons will also run unless disabled via
[`IS_TEST`](https://stack.convex.dev/testing-with-local-oss-backend#setting-up-a-local-backend).
- No way to mock `fetch` calls.
- No way to mock dependencies or parts of the codebase.
- No way to control randomness (tests may not be deterministic).
- No way to set environment variable values from within tests.

To test your functions in JS with a mocked Convex backend, check out
[convex-test](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test).

## CI [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-backend\\#ci \"Direct link to CI\")

See [Continuous Integration](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/ci) to run your tests on a shared
remote machine.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

Environment variables are key-value pairs that are useful for storing values you
wouldn't want to put in code or in a table, such as an API key. You can set
environment variables in Convex through the dashboard, and you can access them
in [functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions) using `process.env`.

## Setting environment variables [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables\\#setting-environment-variables \"Direct link to Setting environment variables\")

Under [Deployment Settings](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/deployment-settings) in the
Dashboard, you can see a list of environment variables in the current
deployment.
![Environment Variables Table](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/environment_variables_table-1d215d0d797cca385b2c94dad4e938b4.png)

You can add up to 100 environment variables. Environment variable names cannot
be more than 40 characters long, and they must start with a letter and only
contain letters numbers, and underscores. Environment variable values cannot be
larger than 8KB.

You can modify environment variables using the pencil icon button:

![Edit Environment Variable](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/edit_environment_variable-24411104aa164c750be92ce82fce3f50.png)

Environment variables can also be viewed and modified with the
[command line](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#read-and-write-environment-variables).

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex env list
npx convex env set API_KEY secret-api-key

```

### Using environment variables in dev and prod deployments [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables\\#using-environment-variables-in-dev-and-prod-deployments \"Direct link to Using environment variables in dev and prod deployments\")

Since environment variables are set per-deployment, you can use different values
for the same key in dev and prod deployments. This can be useful for when you
have different external accounts you'd like to use depending on the environment.
For example, you might have a dev and prod SendGrid account for sending emails,
and your function expects an environment variable called `SENDGRID_API_KEY` that
should work in both environments.

If you expect an environment variable to be always present in a function, you
must add it to **all** your deployments. In this example, you would add an
environment variable with the name `SENDGRID_API_KEY` to your dev and prod
deployments, with a different value for dev and prod.

## Accessing environment variables [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables\\#accessing-environment-variables \"Direct link to Accessing environment variables\")

You can access environment variables in Convex functions using
`process.env.KEY`. If the variable is set it is a `string`, otherwise it is
`undefined`. Here is an example of accessing an environment variable with the
key `GIPHY_KEY`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
function giphyUrl(query) {
  return (
    \"https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/translate?api_key=\" +
    process.env.GIPHY_KEY +
    \"&s=\" +
    encodeURIComponent(query)
  );
}

```

Note that you should not condition your Convex function exports on environment
variables. The set of Convex functions that can be called is determined during
deployment and is not reevaluated when you change an environment variable. The
following code will throw an error at runtime, if the DEBUG environment variable
changes between deployment and calling the function.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// THIS WILL NOT WORK!
export const myFunc = process.env.DEBUG ? mutation(...) : internalMutation(...);

```

Similarly, environment variables used in cron definitions will only be
reevaluated on deployment.

## System environment variables [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables\\#system-environment-variables \"Direct link to System environment variables\")

The following environment variables are always available in Convex functions:

- `CONVEX_CLOUD_URL` \\- Your deployment URL (eg.
`https://dusty-nightingale-847.convex.cloud`) for use with Convex clients.
- `CONVEX_SITE_URL` \\- Your deployment site URL (eg.
`https://dusty-nightingale-847.convex.site`) for use with
[HTTP Actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions)

## Project environment variable defaults [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables\\#project-environment-variable-defaults \"Direct link to Project environment variable defaults\")

You can set up default environment variable values for a project for development
and preview deployments in Project Settings.

![Project Default Environment Variables](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/project_default_environment_variables-94be77c692d0a3c9564cb7f642b6cb64.png)

These default values will be used when creating a new development or preview
deployment, and will have no effect on existing deployments (they are not kept
in sync).

The Deployment Settings will indicate when a deployment has environment
variables that do not match the project defaults.

the \"Team Settings\" button located on the top of the project list page.

## General [​](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/teams\\#general \"Direct link to General\")

The [general page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/team/settings) allows changing
the team name and slug.

You may also delete the team from this page. You can only delete a team after
deleting all of it's projects, and removing all other team members from your
team. Deleting your team will automatically cancel your Convex subscription.

![General team settings page](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/teams_general-be57d90397e8c7890730dfd5d52f29a3.png)

## Team Members [​](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/teams\\#team-members \"Direct link to Team Members\")

Use the
[members settings page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/team/settings/members) to
invite or remove members from your team.

![Team members page](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/teams_members-a49899c63f9a183cb0b684f0353bc678.png)

### Roles and permissions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/teams\\#roles-and-permissions \"Direct link to Roles and permissions\")

Convex has two levels of control for managing access to your team, projects, and
deployments. Team-level roles control what a user can do within the team, while
project-level permissions control what a user can do within a specific project.

#### Team roles [​](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/teams\\#team-roles \"Direct link to Team roles\")

Your team members can have one of the following roles:

- Admin
- Developer

The creator of the team is automatically assigned the Admin role. When inviting
new team members, you may select a role for them. You may also change the role
of a team member at any time.

Developers can:

- Create new projects and deployments. When a new project is created, the
creator of the project is automatically granted the
[Project Admin](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/teams#project-admins) role for that project.
- View existing projects, and create development and preview deployments for
these projects. Developers may read data from production deployments, but
cannot write to them.
- View the team's usage and billing status (such as previous and upcoming
invoices)

Admins can do everything developers can, as well as:

- Invite new team members
- Remove members from the team
- Change the role of other team members
- Manage the team's Convex subscription and billing details.
- Change the team name and slug
- Team Admins are also implicitly granted project admin access to all projects
within the team. See [Project Admins](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/teams#project-admins) for more information.

#### Project Admins [​](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/teams\\#project-admins \"Direct link to Project Admins\")

In addition to team roles, you may also grant admin access to individual
projects by granting team members the \"Project Admin\" role.

If you are a Project Admin for a given project, you may:

- Update the project name and slug
- Update the project's default environment variables
- Delete the project
- Write to production deployments

You may assign and remove the Project Admin role for multiple projects at the
same time on the member settings page. To assign or remove the Project Admin
role for multiple members at the same time, visit the
[Project Settings](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/projects#project-settings) page instead.

## Billing [​](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/teams\\#billing \"Direct link to Billing\")

Use the [billing page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/team/settings/billing) to
upgrade your Convex subscription to a higher tier, or manage your existing
subscription.

On paid plans, you can also update your billing contact details, payment method,
and view your invoices.

# Runtimes

Convex functions can run in two runtimes:

- Default [Convex runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#default-convex-runtime)
- Opt-in [Node.js runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#nodejs-runtime)

## Default Convex runtime [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes\\#default-convex-runtime \"Direct link to Default Convex runtime\")

All Convex backend functions are written in JavaScript or TypeScript. By default
all functions run in a custom JavaScript runtime very similar to the
[Cloudflare Workers runtime](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloud-computing-without-containers/)
with access to most
[web standard globals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects).

The default runtime has many advantages including:

- **No cold starts**. The runtime is always up, and ready to handle any function
at a moments notice.
- **Latest web JavaScript standards**. The runtime is based on V8 that also
powers Google Chrome. This ensures it provides an interface very similar to
your frontend code, allowing further simplification to your code.
- **Low overhead access to your data**. The runtime is designed to have low
overhead access to your data via query & mutation functions, allowing you to
access your database via a simple
[JavaScript interface](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/).

Supported APIs

The default runtime supports most npm libraries that work in the browser,
[Deno](https://deno.com/), and
[Cloudflare workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/). If your
library isn't supported, you can use an action with the
[Node.js runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#nodejs-runtime), or reach out in
[Discord](https://convex.dev/community). We are improving support all the time.

- [CryptoKey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CryptoKey)
- [SubtleCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto)

### Restrictions on queries and mutations [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes\\#restrictions-on-queries-and-mutations \"Direct link to Restrictions on queries and mutations\")

Query and mutation functions are further **restricted by the runtime to be**
**[deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm)**. This
allows Convex to automatically retry them by the system as necessary.

Determinism means that no matter how many times your function is run, as long as
it is given the same arguments, it will have identical side effects and return
the same value.

You don't have to think all that much about maintaining these properties of
determinism when you write your Convex functions. Convex will provide helpful
error messages as you go, so you can't _accidentally_ do something forbidden.

#### Using randomness and time in queries and mutations [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes\\#using-randomness-and-time-in-queries-and-mutations \"Direct link to Using randomness and time in queries and mutations\")

Convex provides a \"seeded\" strong pseudo-random number generator
at `Math.random()` so that it can guarantee the determinism of your function.
The random number generator's seed is an implicit parameter to your function.
Multiple calls to `Math.random()` in one function call will return different
random values. Note that Convex does not reevaluate the Javascript modules on
every function run, so a call to `Math.random()` stored in a global variable
will not change between function runs.

To ensure the logic within your function is reproducible, the system time used
globally (outside of any function) is \"frozen\" at deploy time, while the system
time during Convex function execution is \"frozen\" when the function
begins. `Date.now()` will return the same result for the entirety of your
function's execution. For example,

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const globalRand = Math.random(); // `globalRand` does not change between runs.
const globalNow = Date.now(); // `globalNow` is the time when Convex functions were deployed.

export const updateSomething = mutation({
  handler: () => {
    const now1 = Date.now(); // `now1` is the time when the function execution started.
    const rand1 = Math.random(); // `rand1` has a new value for each function run.
    // implementation
    const now2 = Date.now(); // `now2` === `now1`
    const rand2 = Math.random(); // `rand1` !== `rand2`
  },
});

```

### Actions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes\\#actions \"Direct link to Actions\")

Actions are unrestricted by the same rules of determinism as query and mutation
functions. Notably actions are allowed to call third-party HTTP endpoints via
the browser-standard
[`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) function.

By default actions also run in Convex’s custom JavaScript runtime with all of
its advantages including no cold starts and a browser-like API environment. They
can also live in the same file as your query and mutation functions.

## Node.js runtime [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes\\#nodejs-runtime \"Direct link to Node.js runtime\")

Some JavaScript and TypeScript libraries use features that are not included in
the default Convex runtime. This is why Convex actions provide an escape hatch
to [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/about) via the `\"use node\"` directive at
the top of a file that contains your action.
[Learn more](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions#choosing-the-runtime-use-node).

Use of the Node.js environment is restricted to **action functions only**. If
you want to use a library designed for Node.js and interact with the Convex
database, you need to call the Node.js library from an action, and use
[`runQuery`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions#action-context) or
[`runMutation`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions#action-context) helper to call a
query or mutation.

Every `.ts` and `.js` file in the convex directory
[is bundled](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling) either for the default Convex
JavaScript runtime or Node.js, along with any code it imports.

Files with the `\"use node\"` directive should not contain any Convex queries or
mutations since they cannot be run in the Node.js runtime. Additionally, files
without the `\"use node\"` directive should not import any files with the
`\"use node\"` directive. Files that contain no Convex functions, like a
`convex/utils.ts` file, also need the \"use node\" directive if they use
Node.js-specific libraries.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

This is a list of best practices and common anti-patterns around using Convex.
We recommend going through this list before broadly releasing your app to
production. You may choose to try using all of these best practices from the
start, or you may wait until you've gotten major parts of your app working
before going through and adopting the best practices here.

## Await all Promises [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#await-all-promises \"Direct link to Await all Promises\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why \"Direct link to Why?\")

Convex functions use async / await. If you don't await all your promises (e.g.
`await ctx.scheduler.runAfter`, `await ctx.db.patch`), you may run into
unexpected behavior (e.g. failing to schedule a function) or miss handling
errors.

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how \"Direct link to How?\")

We recommend the
[no-floating-promises](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-floating-promises/)
eslint rule with TypeScript.

## Avoid `.filter` on database queries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#avoid-filter-on-database-queries \"Direct link to avoid-filter-on-database-queries\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-1 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Filtering in code instead of using the `.filter` syntax has the same
performance, and is generally easier code to write. Conditions in `.withIndex`
or `.withSearchIndex` are more efficient than `.filter` or filtering in code, so
almost all uses of `.filter` should either be replaced with a `.withIndex` or
`.withSearchIndex` condition, or written as TypeScript code.

Read through the
[indexes documentation](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/indexes-and-query-perf)
for an overview of how to define indexes and how they work.

### Examples [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#examples \"Direct link to Examples\")

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌
const tomsMessages = ctx.db
  .query(\"messages\")
  .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field(\"author\"), \"Tom\"))
  .collect();

// ✅
// Option 1: Use an index
const tomsMessages = await ctx.db
  .query(\"messages\")
  .withIndex(\"by_author\", (q) => q.eq(\"author\", \"Tom\"))
  .collect();

// Option 2: Filter in code
const allMessages = await ctx.db.query(\"messages\").collect();
const tomsMessages = allMessages.filter((m) => m.author === \"Tom\");

```

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-1 \"Direct link to How?\")

Search for `.filter` in your Convex codebase — a regex like `\\.filter\\(\\(?q`
will probably find all the ones on database queries.

Decide whether they should be replaced with a `.withIndex` condition — per
[this section](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/#only-use-collect-with-a-small-number-of-results),
if you are filtering over a large (1000+) or potentially unbounded number of
documents, you should use an index. If not using a `.withIndex` /
`.withSearchIndex` condition, consider replacing them with a filter in code for
more readability and flexibility.

See [this article](https://stack.convex.dev/complex-filters-in-convex) for more
strategies for filtering.

### Exceptions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#exceptions \"Direct link to Exceptions\")

Using `.filter` on a paginated query ( `.paginate`) has advantages over filtering
in code. The paginated query will return the number of documents requested,
including the `.filter` condition, so filtering in code afterwards can result in
a smaller page or even an empty page. Using `.withIndex` on a paginated query
will still be more efficient than a `.filter`.

## Only use `.collect` with a small number of results [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#only-use-collect-with-a-small-number-of-results \"Direct link to only-use-collect-with-a-small-number-of-results\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-2 \"Direct link to Why?\")

All results returned from `.collect` count towards database bandwidth (even ones
filtered out by `.filter`). It also means that if any document in the result
changes, the query will re-run or the mutation will hit a conflict.

If there's a chance the number of results is large (say 1000+ documents), you
should use an index to filter the results further before calling `.collect`, or
find some other way to avoid loading all the documents such as using pagination,
denormalizing data, or changing the product feature.

### Example [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example \"Direct link to Example\")

**Using an index:**

convex/movies.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- potentially unbounded
const allMovies = await ctx.db.query(\"movies\").collect();
const moviesByDirector = allMovies.filter(
  (m) => m.director === \"Steven Spielberg\",
);

// ✅ -- small number of results, so `collect` is fine
const moviesByDirector = await ctx.db
  .query(\"movies\")
  .withIndex(\"by_director\", (q) => q.eq(\"director\", \"Steven Spielberg\"))
  .collect();

```

**Using pagination:**

convex/movies.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- potentially unbounded
const watchedMovies = await ctx.db
  .query(\"watchedMovies\")
  .withIndex(\"by_user\", (q) => q.eq(\"user\", \"Tom\"))
  .collect();

// ✅ -- using pagination, showing recently watched movies first
const watchedMovies = await ctx.db
  .query(\"watchedMovies\")
  .withIndex(\"by_user\", (q) => q.eq(\"user\", \"Tom\"))
  .order(\"desc\")
  .paginate(paginationOptions);

```

**Using a limit or denormalizing:**

convex/movies.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- potentially unbounded
const watchedMovies = await ctx.db
  .query(\"watchedMovies\")
  .withIndex(\"by_user\", (q) => q.eq(\"user\", \"Tom\"))
  .collect();
const numberOfWatchedMovies = watchedMovies.length;

// ✅ -- Show \"99+\" instead of needing to load all documents
const watchedMovies = await ctx.db
  .query(\"watchedMovies\")
  .withIndex(\"by_user\", (q) => q.eq(\"user\", \"Tom\"))
  .take(100);
const numberOfWatchedMovies =
  watchedMovies.length === 100 ? \"99+\" : watchedMovies.length.toString();

// ✅ -- Denormalize the number of watched movies in a separate table
const watchedMoviesCount = await ctx.db
  .query(\"watchedMoviesCount\")
  .withIndex(\"by_user\", (q) => q.eq(\"user\", \"Tom\"))
  .unique();

```

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-2 \"Direct link to How?\")

Search for `.collect` in your Convex codebase (a regex like `\\.collect\\(` will
probably find these). And think through whether the number of results is small.
This function health page in the dashboard can also help surface these.

The [aggregate component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@convex-dev/aggregate)
or [database triggers](https://stack.convex.dev/triggers) can be helpful
patterns for denormalizing data.

### Exceptions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#exceptions-1 \"Direct link to Exceptions\")

If you're doing something that requires loading a large number of documents
(e.g. performing a migration, making a summary), you may want to use an action
to load them in batches via separate queries / mutations.

## Check for redundant indexes [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#check-for-redundant-indexes \"Direct link to Check for redundant indexes\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-3 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Indexes like `by_foo` and `by_foo_and_bar` are usually redundant (you only need
`by_foo_and_bar`). Reducing the number of indexes saves on database storage and
reduces the overhead of writing to the table.

convex/teams.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌
const allTeamMembers = await ctx.db
  .query(\"teamMembers\")
  .withIndex(\"by_team\", (q) => q.eq(\"team\", teamId))
  .collect();
const currentUserId = /* get current user id from `ctx.auth` */
const currentTeamMember = await ctx.db
  .query(\"teamMembers\")
  .withIndex(\"by_team_and_user\", (q) =>
    q.eq(\"team\", teamId).eq(\"user\", currentUserId),
  )
  .unique();

// ✅
// Just don't include a condition on `user` when querying for results on `team`
const allTeamMembers = await ctx.db
  .query(\"teamMembers\")
  .withIndex(\"by_team_and_user\", (q) => q.eq(\"team\", teamId))
  .collect();
const currentUserId = /* get current user id from `ctx.auth` */
const currentTeamMember = await ctx.db
  .query(\"teamMembers\")
  .withIndex(\"by_team_and_user\", (q) =>
    q.eq(\"team\", teamId).eq(\"user\", currentUserId),
  )
  .unique();

```

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-3 \"Direct link to How?\")

Look through your indexes, either in your `schema.ts` file or in the dashboard,
and look for any indexes where one is a prefix of another.

### Exceptions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#exceptions-2 \"Direct link to Exceptions\")

`.index(\"by_foo\", [\"foo\"])` is really an index on the properties `foo` and
`_creationTime`, while `.index(\"by_foo_and_bar\", [\"foo\", \"bar\"])` is an index on
the properties `foo`, `bar`, and `_creationTime`. If you have queries that need
to be sorted by `foo` and then `_creationTime`, then you need both indexes.

For example, `.index(\"by_channel\", [\"channel\"])` on a table of messages can be
used to query for the most recent messages in a channel, but
`.index(\"by_channel_and_author\", [\"channel\", \"author\"])` could not be used for
this since it would first sort the messages by `author`.

## Use argument validators for all public functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#use-argument-validators-for-all-public-functions \"Direct link to Use argument validators for all public functions\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-4 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Public functions can be called by anyone, including potentially malicious
attackers trying to break your app.
[Argument validators](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation) (as well as return value
validators) help ensure you're getting the traffic you expect.

### Example [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example-1 \"Direct link to Example\")

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- could be used to update any document (not just `messages`)
export const updateMessage = mutation({
  handler: async (ctx, { id, update }) => {
    await ctx.db.patch(id, update);
  },
});

// ✅ -- can only be called with an ID from the messages table, and can only update
// the `body` and `author` fields
export const updateMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"messages\"),
    update: v.object({
      body: v.optional(v.string()),
      author: v.optional(v.string()),
    }),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { id, update }) => {
    await ctx.db.patch(id, update);
  },
});

```

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-4 \"Direct link to How?\")

Search for `query`, `mutation`, and `action` in your Convex codebase, and ensure
that all of them have argument validators (and optionally return value
validators). If you have `httpAction` s, you may want to use something like `zod`
to validate that the HTTP request is the shape you expect.

## Use some form of access control for all public functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#use-some-form-of-access-control-for-all-public-functions \"Direct link to Use some form of access control for all public functions\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-5 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Public functions can be called by anyone, including potentially malicious
attackers trying to break your app. If portions of your app should only be
accessible when the user is signed in, make sure all these Convex functions
check that `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` is set.

You may also have specific checks, like only loading messages that were sent to
or from the current user, which you'll want to apply in every relevant public
function.

Favoring more granular functions like `setTeamOwner` over `updateTeam` allows
more granular checks for which users can do what.

Access control checks should either use `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` or a
function argument that is unguessable (e.g. a UUID, or a Convex ID, provided
that this ID is never exposed to any client but the one user). In particular,
don't use a function argument which could be spoofed (e.g. email) for access
control checks.

### Example [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example-2 \"Direct link to Example\")

convex/teams.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- no checks! anyone can update any team if they get the ID
export const updateTeam = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"teams\"),
    update: v.object({
      name: v.optional(v.string()),
      owner: v.optional(v.id(\"users\")),
    }),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { id, update }) => {
    await ctx.db.patch(id, update);
  },
});

// ❌ -- checks access, but uses `email` which could be spoofed
export const updateTeam = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"teams\"),
    update: v.object({
      name: v.optional(v.string()),
      owner: v.optional(v.id(\"users\")),
    }),
    email: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { id, update, email }) => {
    const teamMembers = /* load team members */
    if (!teamMembers.some((m) => m.email === email)) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    await ctx.db.patch(id, update);
  },
});

// ✅ -- checks access, and uses `ctx.auth`, which cannot be spoofed
export const updateTeam = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"teams\"),
    update: v.object({
      name: v.optional(v.string()),
      owner: v.optional(v.id(\"users\")),
    }),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { id, update }) => {
    const user = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (user === null) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    const isTeamMember = /* check if user is a member of the team */
    if (!isTeamMember) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    await ctx.db.patch(id, update);
  },
});

// ✅ -- separate functions which have different access control
export const setTeamOwner = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"teams\"),
    owner: v.id(\"users\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { id, owner }) => {
    const user = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (user === null) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    const isTeamOwner = /* check if user is the owner of the team */
    if (!isTeamOwner) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    await ctx.db.patch(id, { owner: owner });
  },
});

export const setTeamName = mutation({
  args: {
    id: v.id(\"teams\"),
    name: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { id, name }) => {
    const user = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (user === null) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    const isTeamMember = /* check if user is a member of the team */
    if (!isTeamMember) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    await ctx.db.patch(id, { name: name });
  },
});

```

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-5 \"Direct link to How?\")

Search for `query`, `mutation`, `action`, and `httpAction` in your Convex
codebase, and ensure that all of them have some form of access control.
[Custom functions](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-helpers/blob/main/packages/convex-helpers/README.md#custom-functions)
like
[`authenticatedQuery`](https://stack.convex.dev/custom-functions#modifying-the-ctx-argument-to-a-server-function-for-user-auth)
can be helpful.

Some apps use Row Level Security (RLS) to check access to each document
automatically whenever it's loaded, as described in
[this article](https://stack.convex.dev/row-level-security). Alternatively, you
can check access in each Convex function instead of checking access for each
document.

Helper functions for common checks and common operations can also be useful --
e.g. `isTeamMember`, `isTeamAdmin`, `loadTeam` (which throws if the current user
does not have access to the team).

## Only schedule and `ctx.run*` internal functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#only-schedule-and-ctxrun-internal-functions \"Direct link to only-schedule-and-ctxrun-internal-functions\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-6 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Public functions can be called by anyone, including potentially malicious
attackers trying to break your app, and should be carefully audited to ensure
they can't be used maliciously. Functions that are only called within Convex can
be marked as internal, and relax these checks since Convex will ensure that
internal functions can only be called within Convex.

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-6 \"Direct link to How?\")

Search for `ctx.runQuery`, `ctx.runMutation`, and `ctx.runAction` in your Convex
codebase. Also search for `ctx.scheduler` and check the `crons.ts` file. Ensure
all of these use `internal.foo.bar` functions instead of `api.foo.bar`
functions.

If you have code you want to share between a public Convex function and an
internal Convex function, create a helper function that can be called from both.
The public function will likely have additional access control checks.

Alternatively, make sure that `api` from `_generated/api.ts` is never used in
your Convex functions directory.

### Examples [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#examples-1 \"Direct link to Examples\")

convex/teams.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- using `api`
export const sendMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    body: v.string(),
    author: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { body, author }) => {
    // add message to the database
  },
});

// crons.ts
crons.daily(
  \"send daily reminder\",
  { hourUTC: 17, minuteUTC: 30 },
  api.messages.sendMessage,
  { author: \"System\", body: \"Share your daily update!\" },
);

// ✅ Using `internal`
import { MutationCtx } from './_generated/server';
async function sendMessageHelper(
  ctx: MutationCtx,
  args: { body: string; author: string },
) {
  // add message to the database
}

export const sendMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    body: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { body }) => {
    const user = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (user === null) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    await sendMessageHelper(ctx, { body, author: user.name ?? \"Anonymous\" });
  },
});

export const sendInternalMessage = internalMutation({
  args: {
    body: v.string(),
    // don't need to worry about `author` being spoofed since this is an internal function
    author: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { body, author }) => {
    await sendMessageHelper(ctx, { body, author });
  },
});

// crons.ts
crons.daily(
  \"send daily reminder\",
  { hourUTC: 17, minuteUTC: 30 },
  internal.messages.sendInternalMessage,
  { author: \"System\", body: \"Share your daily update!\" },
);

```

## Use helper functions to write shared code [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#use-helper-functions-to-write-shared-code \"Direct link to Use helper functions to write shared code\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-7 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Most logic should be written as plain TypeScript functions, with the `query`,
`mutation`, and `action` wrapper functions being a thin wrapper around one or
more helper function.

Concretely, most of your code should live in a directory like `convex/model`,
and your public API, which is defined with `query`, `mutation`, and `action`,
should have very short functions that mostly just call into `convex/model`.

Organizing your code this way makes several of the refactors mentioned in this
list easier to do.

See the [TypeScript page](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/typescript) for
useful types.

### Example [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example-3 \"Direct link to Example\")

**❌** This example overuses `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation`, which is
discussed more in the
[Avoid sequential `ctx.runMutation` / `ctx.runQuery` from actions](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/#avoid-sequential-ctx-runmutation-ctx-runquery-from-actions)
section.

convex/users.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const getCurrentUser = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const userIdentity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (userIdentity === null) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    const user = /* query ctx.db to load the user */
    const userSettings = /* load other documents related to the user */
    return { user, settings: userSettings };
  },
});

```

convex/conversations.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const listMessages = query({
  args: {
    conversationId: v.id(\"conversations\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { conversationId }) => {
    const user = await ctx.runQuery(api.users.getCurrentUser);
    const conversation = await ctx.db.get(conversationId);
    if (conversation === null || !conversation.members.includes(user._id)) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthorized\");
    }
    const messages = /* query ctx.db to load the messages */
    return messages;
  },
});

export const summarizeConversation = action({
  args: {
    conversationId: v.id(\"conversations\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { conversationId }) => {
    const messages = await ctx.runQuery(api.conversations.listMessages, {

    const summary = /* call some external service to summarize the conversation */
    await ctx.runMutation(api.conversations.addSummary, {
      conversationId,
      summary,
    });
  },
});

```

**✅** Most of the code here is now in the `convex/model` directory. The API for
this application is in `convex/conversations.ts`, which contains very little
code itself.

## Use `runAction` only when using a different runtime [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#use-runaction-only-when-using-a-different-runtime \"Direct link to use-runaction-only-when-using-a-different-runtime\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-8 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Calling `runAction` has more overhead than calling a plain TypeScript function.
It counts as an extra function call with its own memory and CPU usage, while the
parent action is doing nothing except waiting for the result. Therefore,
`runAction` should almost always be replaced with calling a plain TypeScript
function. However, if you want to call code that requires Node.js from a
function in the Convex runtime (e.g. using a library that requires Node.js),
then you can use `runAction` to call the Node.js code.

### Example [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example-4 \"Direct link to Example\")

convex/scrape.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- using `runAction`
export const scrapeWebsite = action({
  args: {
    siteMapUrl: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { siteMapUrl }) => {
    const siteMap = await fetch(siteMapUrl);
    const pages = /* parse the site map */
    await Promise.all(
      pages.map((page) =>
        ctx.runAction(internal.scrape.scrapeSinglePage, { url: page }),
      ),
    );
  },
});

```

convex/model/scrape.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { ActionCtx } from '../_generated/server';

// ✅ -- using a plain TypeScript function
export async function scrapeSinglePage(
  ctx: ActionCtx,
  { url }: { url: string },
) {
  const page = await fetch(url);
  const text = /* parse the page */
  await ctx.runMutation(internal.scrape.addPage, { url, text });
}

```

convex/scrape.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import * as Scrape from './model/scrape';

export const scrapeWebsite = action({
  args: {
    siteMapUrl: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { siteMapUrl }) => {
    const siteMap = await fetch(siteMapUrl);
    const pages = /* parse the site map */
    await Promise.all(
      pages.map((page) => Scrape.scrapeSinglePage(ctx, { url: page })),
    );
  },
});

```

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-7 \"Direct link to How?\")

Search for `runAction` in your Convex codebase, and see if the function it calls
uses the same runtime as the parent function. If so, replace the `runAction`
with a plain TypeScript function. You may want to structure your functions so
the Node.js functions are in a separate directory so it's easier to spot these.

## Avoid sequential `ctx.runMutation` / `ctx.runQuery` calls from actions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#avoid-sequential-ctxrunmutation--ctxrunquery-calls-from-actions \"Direct link to avoid-sequential-ctxrunmutation--ctxrunquery-calls-from-actions\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-9 \"Direct link to Why?\")

Each `ctx.runMutation` or `ctx.runQuery` runs in its own transaction, which
means if they're called separately, they may not be consistent with each other.
If instead we call a single `ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation`, we're
guaranteed that the results we get are consistent.

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-8 \"Direct link to How?\")

Audit your calls to `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation` in actions. If you see
multiple in a row with no other code between them, replace them with a single
`ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation` that handles both things. Refactoring your
code to use helper functions will make this easier.

### Example: Queries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example-queries \"Direct link to Example: Queries\")

convex/teams.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ -- this assertion could fail if the team changed between running the two queries
const team = await ctx.runQuery(internal.teams.getTeam, { teamId });
const teamOwner = await ctx.runQuery(internal.teams.getTeamOwner, { teamId });
assert(team.owner === teamOwner._id);

```

convex/teams.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import * as Teams from './model/teams';
import * as Users from './model/users';

export const sendBillingReminder = action({
  args: {
    teamId: v.id(\"teams\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { teamId }) => {
    // ✅ -- this will always pass
    const teamAndOwner = await ctx.runQuery(internal.teams.getTeamAndOwner, {
      teamId,
    });
    assert(teamAndOwner.team.owner === teamAndOwner.owner._id);
    // send a billing reminder email to the owner
  },
});

export const getTeamAndOwner = internalQuery({
  args: {
    teamId: v.id(\"teams\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { teamId }) => {
    const team = await Teams.load(ctx, { teamId });
    const owner = await Users.load(ctx, { userId: team.owner });
    return { team, owner };
  },
});

```

### Example: Loops [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#example-loops \"Direct link to Example: Loops\")

convex/teams.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import * as Users from './model/users';

export const importTeams = action({
  args: {
    teamId: v.id(\"teams\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { teamId }) => {
    // Fetch team members from an external API
    const teamMembers = await fetchTeamMemberData(teamId);

    // ❌ This will run a separate mutation for inserting each user,
    // which means you lose transaction guarantees like atomicity.
    for (const member of teamMembers) {
      await ctx.runMutation(internal.teams.insertUser, member);
    }
  },
});
export const insertUser = internalMutation({
  args: { name: v.string(), email: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, { name, email }) => {
    await Users.insert(ctx, { name, email });
  },
});

```

convex/teams.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import * as Users from './model/users';

export const importTeams = action({
  args: {
    teamId: v.id(\"teams\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { teamId }) => {
    // Fetch team members from an external API
    const teamMembers = await fetchTeamMemberData(teamId);

    // ✅ This action runs a single mutation that inserts all users in the same transaction.
    await ctx.runMutation(internal.teams.insertUsers, teamMembers);
  },
});
export const insertUsers = internalMutation({
  args: { users: v.array(v.object({ name: v.string(), email: v.string() })) },
  handler: async (ctx, { users }) => {
    for (const { name, email } of users) {
      await Users.insert(ctx, { name, email });
    }
  },
});

```

### Exceptions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#exceptions-3 \"Direct link to Exceptions\")

If you're intentionally trying to process more data than fits in a single
transaction, like running a migration or aggregating data, then it makes sense
to have multiple sequential `ctx.runMutation` / `ctx.runQuery` calls.

Multiple `ctx.runQuery` / `ctx.runMutation` calls are often necessary because
the action does a side effect in between them. For example, reading some data,
feeding it to an external service, and then writing the result back to the
database.

## Use `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation` sparingly in queries and mutations [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#use-ctxrunquery-and-ctxrunmutation-sparingly-in-queries-and-mutations \"Direct link to use-ctxrunquery-and-ctxrunmutation-sparingly-in-queries-and-mutations\")

### Why? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#why-10 \"Direct link to Why?\")

While these queries and mutations run in the same transaction, and will give
consistent results, they have extra overhead compared to plain TypeScript
functions. Wanting a TypeScript helper function is much more common than needing
`ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation`.

### How? [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#how-9 \"Direct link to How?\")

Audit your calls to `ctx.runQuery` and `ctx.runMutation` in queries and
mutations. Unless one of the exceptions below applies, replace them with a plain
TypeScript function.

### Exceptions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices\\#exceptions-4 \"Direct link to Exceptions\")

- If you're using components, these require `ctx.runQuery` or `ctx.runMutation`.
- If you want partial rollback on an error, you will want `ctx.runMutation`
instead of a plain TypeScript function.

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const trySendMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    body: v.string(),
    author: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, { body, author }) => {
    try {
      await ctx.runMutation(internal.messages.sendMessage, { body, author });
    } catch (e) {
      // Record the failure, but rollback any writes from `sendMessage`
      await ctx.db.insert(\"failures\", {
        kind: \"MessageFailed\",
        body,
        author,
        error: `Error: ${e}`,
      });
    }
  },

On this page

Mutations insert, update and remove data from the database, check authentication
or perform other business logic, and optionally return a response to the client
application.

This is an example mutation, taking in named arguments, writing data to the
database and returning a result:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

// Create a new task with the given text
export const createTask = mutation({
  args: { text: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const newTaskId = await ctx.db.insert(\"tasks\", { text: args.text });
    return newTaskId;
  },
});

```

Read on to understand how to build mutations yourself.

## Mutation names [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions\\#mutation-names \"Direct link to Mutation names\")

Mutations follow the same naming rules as queries, see
[Query names](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#query-names).

Queries and mutations can be defined in the same file when using named exports.

## The `mutation` constructor [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions\\#the-mutation-constructor \"Direct link to the-mutation-constructor\")

To declare a mutation in Convex use the `mutation` constructor function. Pass it
an object with a `handler` function, which performs the mutation:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const mutateSomething = mutation({
  handler: () => {
    // implementation will be here
  },
});

```

Unlike a query, a mutation can but does not have to return a value.

### Mutation arguments [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions\\#mutation-arguments \"Direct link to Mutation arguments\")

Just like queries, mutations accept named arguments, and the argument values are
accessible as fields of the second parameter of the `handler` function:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const mutateSomething = mutation({
  handler: (_, args: { a: number; b: number }) => {
    // do something with `args.a` and `args.b`

    // optionally return a value
    return \"success\";
  },
});

```

Arguments and responses are automatically serialized and deserialized, and you
can pass and return most value-like JavaScript data to and from your mutation.

To both declare the types of arguments and to validate them, add an `args`
object using `v` validators:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const mutateSomething = mutation({
  args: { a: v.number(), b: v.number() },
  handler: (_, args) => {
    // do something with `args.a` and `args.b`
  },
});

```

See [argument validation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation) for the full list of
supported types and validators.

The first parameter to the handler function is reserved for the mutation
context.

### Mutation responses [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions\\#mutation-responses \"Direct link to Mutation responses\")

Queries can return values of any supported
[Convex type](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation) which will be automatically
serialized and deserialized.

Mutations can also return `undefined`, which is not a valid Convex value. When a
mutation returns `undefined` **it is translated to `null`** on the client.

### Mutation context [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions\\#mutation-context \"Direct link to Mutation context\")

The `mutation` constructor enables writing data to the database, and other
Convex features by passing a
[MutationCtx](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server#mutationctx) object to the handler
function as the first parameter:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const mutateSomething = mutation({
  args: { a: v.number(), b: v.number() },
  handler: (ctx, args) => {
    // Do something with `ctx`
  },
});

```

Which part of the mutation context is used depends on what your mutation needs
to do:

- To read from and write to the database use the `db` field. Note that we make
the handler function an `async` function so we can `await` the promise
returned by `db.insert()`:







convex/myFunctions.ts







TS

















```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const addItem = mutation({
    args: { text: v.string() },
    handler: async (ctx, args) => {
      await ctx.db.insert(\"tasks\", { text: args.text });
    },
});

```









Read on about [Writing Data](https://docs.convex.dev/database/writing-data).

- To generate upload URLs for storing files use the `storage` field. Read on
about [File Storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage).

- To check user authentication use the `auth` field. Read on about
[Authentication](https://docs.convex.dev/auth).

- To schedule functions to run in the future, use the `scheduler` field. Read on
about [Scheduled Functions](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions).


## Splitting up mutation code via helpers [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions\\#splitting-up-mutation-code-via-helpers \"Direct link to Splitting up mutation code via helpers\")

When you want to split up the code in your mutation or reuse logic across
multiple Convex functions you can define and call helper

TypeScript

functions:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { v } from \"convex/values\";
import { mutation, MutationCtx } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const addItem = mutation({
  args: { text: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    await ctx.db.insert(\"tasks\", { text: args.text });
    await trackChange(ctx, \"addItem\");
  },
});

async function trackChange(ctx: MutationCtx, type: \"addItem\" | \"removeItem\") {
  await ctx.db.insert(\"changes\", { type });
}

```

Mutations can call helpers that take a
[QueryCtx](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server#queryctx) as argument, since the
mutation context can do everything query context can.

You can `export` helpers to use them across multiple files. They will not be
callable from outside of your Convex functions.

See
[Type annotating server side helpers](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/typescript#type-annotating-server-side-helpers)
for more guidance on TypeScript types.

## Using NPM packages [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions\\#using-npm-packages \"Direct link to Using NPM packages\")

Mutations can import NPM packages installed in `node_modules`. Not all NPM
packages are supported, see
[Runtimes](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#default-convex-runtime) for more
details.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm install @faker-js/faker

```

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { faker } from \"@faker-js/faker\";
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const randomName = mutation({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    faker.seed();
    await ctx.db.insert(\"tasks\", { text: \"Greet \" + faker.person.fullName() });
  },
});

```

## Calling mutations from clients [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions\\#calling-mutations-from-clients \"Direct link to Calling mutations from clients\")

To call a mutation from [React](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react) use the generated
[`useMutation`](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#editing-data) hook:

To call a mutation from [React](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react) use the
[`useMutation`](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#editing-data) hook along with the generated
[`api`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/api) object.

src/myApp.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useMutation } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function MyApp() {
  const mutateSomething = useMutation(api.myFunctions.mutateSomething);
  const handleClick = () => {
    mutateSomething({ a: 1, b: 2 });
  };
  // pass `handleClick` to a button
  // ...
}

```

See the [React](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react) client documentation for all the ways
queries can be called.

When mutations are called from the [React](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react) or
[Rust](https://docs.convex.dev/client/rust) clients, they are executed one at a time in a single,
ordered queue. You don't have to worry about mutations editing the database in a
different order than they were triggered.

## Transactions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions\\#transactions \"Direct link to Transactions\")

Mutations run **transactionally**. This means that:

1. All database reads inside the transaction get a consistent view of the data
in the database. You don't have to worry about a concurrent update changing
the data in the middle of the execution.
2. All database writes get committed together. If the mutation writes some data
to the database, but later throws an error, no data is actually written to
the database.

For this to work, similarly to queries, mutations must be deterministic, and
cannot call third party APIs. To call third party APIs, use
[actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions).

## Limits [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions\\#limits \"Direct link to Limits\")

Mutations have a limit to the amount of data they can read and write at once to
guarantee good performance. Check out these limits
[here](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/#database-limitations).

For information on other limits, see [here](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/#database-limitations).

Convex Components package up code and data in a sandbox that allows you to
confidently and quickly add new features to your backend.

Convex Components are like mini self-contained Convex backends, and installing
them is always safe. They can't read your app's tables or call your app's
functions unless you pass them in explicitly.

You can read about the full vision in
[Convex: The Software-Defined Database](https://stack.convex.dev/the-software-defined-database#introducing-convex-components)

The Convex team has built a few components that add new features to your
backend. You'll eventually be able to author your own components to use within
your project and to share with the community, but we haven't stabilized and
documented the authoring APIs yet.

We've listed components built by the Convex team below. Each component is
installed as its own independent library from NPM. Check out the component's
README for installation and usage instructions. You can see the full directory
on the [Convex website](https://convex.dev/components).

The component authoring APIs are in Beta

The underlying authoring APIs for components are still in flux. The Convex
team authored components listed below will be kept up to date as the APIs
change.

## Understanding Components [​](https://docs.convex.dev/components\\#understanding-components \"Direct link to Understanding Components\")

Components can be thought of as a combination of concepts from frontend
components, third party APIs, and both monolith and service-oriented
architectures.

### Data [​](https://docs.convex.dev/components\\#data \"Direct link to Data\")

Similar to frontend components, Convex Components encapsulate state and behavior
and allow exposing a clean interface. However, instead of just storing state in
memory, these can have internal state machines that can persist between user
sessions, span users, and change in response to external inputs, such as
webhooks. Components can store data in a few ways:

- Database tables with their own schema validation definitions. Since Convex is
realtime by default, data reads are automatically reactive, and writes commit
transactionally.
- File storage, independent of the main app’s file storage.
- Durable functions via the built-in function scheduler. Components can reliably
schedule functions to run in the future and pass along state.

Typically, libraries require configuring a third party service to add stateful
off-the-shelf functionality, which lack the transactional guarantees that come
from storing state in the same database.

### Isolation [​](https://docs.convex.dev/components\\#isolation \"Direct link to Isolation\")

Similar to regular npm libraries, Convex Components include functions, type
safety, and are called from your code. However, they also provide extra
guarantees.

- Similar to a third-party API, components can’t read data for which you don’t
provide access. This includes database tables, file storage, environment
variables, scheduled functions, etc.
- Similar to service-oriented architecture, functions in components are run in
an isolated environment, so they can’t read or write global variables or patch
system behavior.
- Similar to a monolith architecture, data changes commit transactionally across
calls to components, without having to reason about complicated distributed
commit protocols or data inconsistencies. You’ll never have a component commit
data but have the calling code roll back.
- In addition, each mutation call to a component is a sub-mutation isolated from
other calls, allowing you to safely catch errors thrown by components. It also
allows component authors to easily reason about state changes without races,
and trust that a thrown exception will always roll back the Component’s
sub-mutation. [Read more](https://docs.convex.dev/components/using-components#transactions).

### Encapsulation [​](https://docs.convex.dev/components\\#encapsulation \"Direct link to Encapsulation\")

Being able to reason about your code is essential to scaling a codebase.
Components allow you to reason about API boundaries and abstractions.

- The transactional guarantees discussed above allows authors and users of
components to reason locally about data changes.
- Components expose an explicit API, not direct database table access. Data
invariants can be enforced in code, within the abstraction boundary. For
example, the [aggregate component](https://convex.dev/components/aggregate)
can internally denormalize data, the
[rate limiter](https://convex.dev/components/rate-limiter) component can shard
its data, and the
[push notification](https://convex.dev/components/push-notifications)
component can internally batch API requests, while maintaining simple
interfaces.
- Runtime validation ensures all data that cross a component boundary are
validated: both arguments and return values. As with normal Convex functions,
the validators also specify the TypeScript types, providing end-to-end typing
with runtime guarantees.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/nodejs#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

Learn how to query data from Convex in a Node.js project.

For instructions for subscriptions instead of point-in-time queries and more
project configurations (TypeScript, bundlers, CJS vs ESM) see
[Node.js notes](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript/node).

1. Create a new npm project



Create a new directory for your Node.js project.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
mkdir my-project && cd my-project && npm init -y && npm pkg set type=\"module\"

```

2. Install the Convex client and server library



Install the `convex`
package which provides a convenient interface for working
with Convex from JavaScript.



Also install the `dotenv` library for loading `.env` files.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm install convex dotenv

```

3. Set up a Convex dev deployment



Next, run `npx convex dev`. This
will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.



It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
will then continue running to sync your functions
with your dev deployment in the cloud.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dev

```

4. Create sample data for your database



In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl`
file with some sample data.









sampleData.jsonl





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
{\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
{\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

```

5. Add the sample data to your database



Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table
with the sample data into your Convex database with
the `import` command.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

```

6. Expose a database query



Add a new file `tasks.js` in the `convex/` folder
with a query function that loads the data.



Exporting a query function from this file
declares an API function named after the file
and the export name, `api.tasks.get`.









convex/tasks.js





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const get = query({
     args: {},
     handler: async (ctx) => {
       return await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
     },
});

```

7. Connect the script to your backend



In a new file `script.js`, create a `ConvexHttpClient` using
the URL of your development environment.









script.js





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { ConvexHttpClient } from \"convex/browser\";
import { api } from \"./convex/_generated/api.js\";
import * as dotenv from \"dotenv\";
dotenv.config({ path: \".env.local\" });

const client = new ConvexHttpClient(process.env[\"CONVEX_URL\"]);

client.query(api.tasks.get).then(console.log);

```

8. Run the script



Run the script from the same directory and see the list of tasks logged to the terminal.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
node script.js

```

Please [contact us](mailto:support@convex.dev) with any specific requirements or
if you want to build a project on Convex that is not yet satisfied by our
guarantees.

## Guarantees [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state\\#guarantees \"Direct link to Guarantees\")

The official Convex Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and Customer Agreements are
[outlined in our official terms](https://www.convex.dev/legal/tos). We do not
yet have contractual agreements beyond what is listed in our official terms and
the discussions within this document don't constitute an amendment to these
terms.

Convex is always under continual development and future releases may require
code changes in order to upgrade to a new version. Code developed on Convex 1.0
or later will continue to operate as-is. If we are required to make a breaking
change in future we will contact teams directly to provide substantial advance
notice.

All user data in Convex is encrypted at rest. Database state is replicated
durably across multiple physical availability zones. Regular periodic and
incremental database backups are performed and stored with 99.999999999% (11
9's) durability.

We target an availability of 99.99% (4 9's) for Convex deployments although
these may experience downtime for maintenance without notice. A physical outage
may affect availability of a deployment but will not affect durability of the
data stored in Convex.

## Limits [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state\\#limits \"Direct link to Limits\")

For information on limits, see [here](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits).

## Beta Features [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state\\#beta-features \"Direct link to Beta Features\")

Features tagged with **beta** in these docs are still in development. They can
be used in production but their APIs might change in the future, requiring
additional effort when upgrading to a new version of the Convex NPM package and
other Convex client libraries.

## Future Features [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state\\#future-features \"Direct link to Future Features\")

Convex is still under very active development and here we list some of the
missing functionality on our radar. We'd love to hear more about your
requirements in the [Convex Discord Community](https://convex.dev/community).

### Authorization [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state\\#authorization \"Direct link to Authorization\")

Convex currently has an [_authentication framework_](https://docs.convex.dev/auth) which
verifies user identities. In the future we plan to add an _authorization_
_framework_ which will allow developers to define what data a user can access.

For now, you can implement manual authorization checks within your queries and
mutations, but stay tuned for a more comprehensive, fool-proof solution in the
future.

### Telemetry [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state\\#telemetry \"Direct link to Telemetry\")

Currently, the dashboard provides only basic metrics. Serious sites at scale are
going to need to integrate our logs and metrics into more fully fledged
observability systems that categorize them and empower things like alerting.

Convex will eventually have methods to publish deployment data in formats that
can be ingested by third parties.

### Analytics / OLAP [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state\\#analytics--olap \"Direct link to Analytics / OLAP\")

Convex is designed to primarily service all your app's realtime implementation
(OLTP) needs. It is less suited to be a good solution for the kinds of complex
queries and huge table scans that are necessary to address the requirements of
analytics (OLAP) use cases.

Convex exposes
[Fivetran and Airbyte connectors](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/streaming-import-export)
to export Convex data to external analytics systems.

### Browser support [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state\\#browser-support \"Direct link to Browser support\")

Convex does not yet have an official browser support policy, but we strive to
support most modern browsers with significant
[usage](https://caniuse.com/usage-table).

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

**Example:** [Relational Data Modeling](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/relational-data-modeling)

Every document in convex has a globally unique string _document ID_ that is
automatically generated by the system.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const userId = await ctx.db.insert(\"users\", { name: \"Michael Jordan\" });

```

You can use this ID to efficiently read a single document using the `get`
method:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const retrievedUser = await ctx.db.get(userId);

```

You can access the ID of a document in the
[`_id` field](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types#system-fields):

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const userId = retrievedUser._id;

```

Also, this same ID can be used to update that document in place:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
await ctx.db.patch(userId, { name: \"Steph Curry\" });

```

Convex generates an [`Id`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/data-model#id) TypeScript type based
on your [schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) that is parameterized over your
table names:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { Id } from \"./_generated/dataModel\";

const userId: Id<\"users\"> = user._id;

```

IDs are strings at runtime, but the [`Id`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/data-model#id) type
can be used to distinguish IDs from other strings at compile time.

## References and relationships [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids\\#references-and-relationships \"Direct link to References and relationships\")

In Convex, you can reference a document simply by embedding its `Id` in another
document:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
await ctx.db.insert(\"books\", {
  title,
  ownerId: user._id,
});

```

You can follow references with `ctx.db.get`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const user = await ctx.db.get(book.ownerId);

```

And [query for documents](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/) with a
reference:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const myBooks = await ctx.db
  .query(\"books\")
  .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field(\"ownerId\"), user._id))
  .collect();

```

Using `Id` s as references can allow you to build a complex data model.

## Trading off deeply nested documents vs. relationships [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids\\#trading-off-deeply-nested-documents-vs-relationships \"Direct link to Trading off deeply nested documents vs. relationships\")

While it's useful that Convex supports nested objects and arrays, you should
keep documents relatively small in size. In practice, we recommend limiting
Arrays to no more than 5-10 elements and avoiding deeply nested Objects.

Instead, leverage separate tables, documents, and references to structure your
data. This will lead to better maintainability and performance as your project
grows.

## Serializing IDs [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids\\#serializing-ids \"Direct link to Serializing IDs\")

IDs are strings, which can be easily inserted into URLs or stored outside of
Convex.

You can pass an ID string from an external source (like a URL) into a Convex
function and get the corresponding object. If you're using TypeScript on the
client you can cast a string to the `Id` type:

src/App.tsx

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useQuery } from \"convex/react\";
import { Id } from \"../convex/_generated/dataModel\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function App() {
  const id = localStorage.getItem(\"myIDStorage\");
  const task = useQuery(api.tasks.getTask, { taskId: id as Id<\"tasks\"> });
  // ...
}

```

Since this ID is coming from an external source, use an argument validator or
[`ctx.db.normalizeId`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericDatabaseReader#normalizeid)
to confirm that the ID belongs to the expected table before returning the
object.

convex/tasks.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const getTask = query({
  args: {
    taskId: v.id(\"tasks\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const task = await ctx.db.get(args.taskId);
    // ...
  },
});

```

On this page

A schema is a description of

1. the tables in your Convex project
2. the type of documents within your tables

While it is possible to use Convex _without_ defining a schema, adding a
`schema.ts` file will ensure that the documents in your tables are the correct
type. If you're using
[TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/typescript), adding a schema
will also give you end-to-end type safety throughout your app.

We recommend beginning your project without a schema for rapid prototyping and
then adding a schema once you've solidified your plan. To learn more see our
[Schema Philosophy](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/schema-philosophy).

**Example:** [TypeScript and Schemas](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/typescript)

## Writing schemas [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#writing-schemas \"Direct link to Writing schemas\")

Schemas are defined in a `schema.ts` file in your `convex/` directory and look
like:

convex/schema.ts

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from \"convex/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export default defineSchema({
  messages: defineTable({
    body: v.string(),
    user: v.id(\"users\"),
  }),
  users: defineTable({
    name: v.string(),
    tokenIdentifier: v.string(),
  }).index(\"by_token\", [\"tokenIdentifier\"]),
});

```

This schema (which is based on our
[users and auth example](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/users-and-auth)),
has 2 tables: messages and users. Each table is defined using the
[`defineTable`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server#definetable) function. Within each table,
the document type is defined using the validator builder,
[`v`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/values#v). In addition to the fields listed, Convex will also
automatically add `_id` and `_creationTime` fields. To learn more, see
[System Fields](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types#system-fields).

Generating a Schema

While writing your schema, it can be helpful to consult the
[Convex Dashboard](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/data#generating-a-schema). The
\"Generate Schema\" button in the \"Data\" view suggests a schema declaration based
on the data in your tables.

### Validators [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#validators \"Direct link to Validators\")

The validator builder, [`v`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/values#v) is used to define the type
of documents in each table. It has methods for each of
[Convex's types](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types):

convex/schema.ts

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from \"convex/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export default defineSchema({
  documents: defineTable({
    id: v.id(\"documents\"),
    string: v.string(),
    number: v.number(),
    boolean: v.boolean(),
    nestedObject: v.object({
      property: v.string(),
    }),
  }),
});

```

It additionally allows you to define unions, optional property, string literals,
and more. [Argument validation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation) and schemas both
use the same validator builder, `v`.

#### Optional fields [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#optional-fields \"Direct link to Optional fields\")

You can describe optional fields by wrapping their type with `v.optional(...)`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
defineTable({
  optionalString: v.optional(v.string()),
  optionalNumber: v.optional(v.number()),
});

```

This corresponds to marking fields as optional with `?` in TypeScript.

#### Unions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#unions \"Direct link to Unions\")

You can describe fields that could be one of multiple types using `v.union`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
defineTable({
  stringOrNumber: v.union(v.string(), v.number()),
});

```

If your table stores multiple different types of documents, you can use
`v.union` at the top level:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
defineTable(
  v.union(
    v.object({
      kind: v.literal(\"StringDocument\"),
      value: v.string(),
    }),
    v.object({
      kind: v.literal(\"NumberDocument\"),
      value: v.number(),
    }),
  ),
);

```

In this schema, documents either have a `kind` of `\"StringDocument\"` and a
string for their `value`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{
  \"kind\": \"StringDocument\",
  \"value\": \"abc\"
}

```

or they have a `kind` of `\"NumberDocument\"` and a number for their `value`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{
  \"kind\": \"NumberDocument\",
  \"value\": 123
}

```

#### Literals [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#literals \"Direct link to Literals\")

Fields that are a constant can be expressed with `v.literal`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
defineTable({
  oneTwoOrThree: v.union(
    v.literal(\"one\"),
    v.literal(\"two\"),
    v.literal(\"three\"),
  ),
});

```

#### Record objects [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#record-objects \"Direct link to Record objects\")

You can describe objects that map arbitrary keys to values with `v.record`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
defineTable({
  simpleMapping: v.record(v.string(), v.boolean()),
});

```

You can use other types of string validators for the keys:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export default mutation({
  args: {
    userIdToValue: v.record(v.id(\"users\"), v.boolean()),
  },
  handler: async ({ db }, { userIdToValue }) => {
    //...
  },
});

```

Notes:

- This type corresponds to the
[Record<K,V>](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeys-type)
type in TypeScript
- You cannot use string literals as a `record` key
- Using `v.string()` as a `record` key validator will only allow ASCII
characters

#### Any [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#any \"Direct link to Any\")

Fields or documents that could take on any value can be represented with
`v.any()`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
defineTable({
  anyValue: v.any(),
});

```

This corresponds to the `any` type in TypeScript.

### Options [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#options \"Direct link to Options\")

These options are passed as part of the
[options](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.DefineSchemaOptions) argument to
[`defineSchema`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/server#defineschema).

#### `schemaValidation: boolean` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#schemavalidation-boolean \"Direct link to schemavalidation-boolean\")

Whether Convex should validate at runtime that your documents match your schema.

By default, Convex will enforce that all new and existing documents match your
schema.

You can disable `schemaValidation` by passing in `schemaValidation: false`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
defineSchema(
  {
    // Define tables here.
  },
  {
    schemaValidation: false,
  },
);

```

When `schemaValidation` is disabled, Convex will not validate that new or
existing documents match your schema. You'll still get schema-specific
TypeScript types, but there will be no validation at runtime that your documents
match those types.

#### `strictTableNameTypes: boolean` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#stricttablenametypes-boolean \"Direct link to stricttablenametypes-boolean\")

Whether the TypeScript types should allow accessing tables not in the schema.

By default, the TypeScript table name types produced by your schema are strict.
That means that they will be a union of strings (ex. `\"messages\" | \"users\"`) and
only support accessing tables explicitly listed in your schema.

Sometimes it's useful to only define part of your schema. For example, if you
are rapidly prototyping, it could be useful to try out a new table before adding
it your `schema.ts` file.

You can disable `strictTableNameTypes` by passing in
`strictTableNameTypes: false`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
defineSchema(
  {
    // Define tables here.
  },
  {
    strictTableNameTypes: false,
  },
);

```

When `strictTableNameTypes` is disabled, the TypeScript types will allow access
to tables not listed in the schema and their document type will be `any`.

Regardless of the value of `strictTableNameTypes`, your schema will only
validate documents in the tables listed in the schema. You can still create and
modify documents in other tables in JavaScript or on the dashboard (they just
won't be validated).

## Schema validation [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#schema-validation \"Direct link to Schema validation\")

Schemas are pushed automatically in
[`npx convex dev`](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#run-the-convex-dev-server) and
[`npx convex deploy`](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#deploy-convex-functions-to-production).

The first push after a schema is added or modified will validate that all
existing documents match the schema. If there are documents that fail
validation, the push will fail.

After the schema is pushed, Convex will validate that all future document
inserts and updates match the schema.

Schema validation is skipped if [`schemaValidation`](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas#schemavalidation-boolean)
is set to `false`.

Note that schemas only validate documents in the tables listed in the schema.
You can still create and modify documents in other tables (they just won't be
validated).

### Circular references [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#circular-references \"Direct link to Circular references\")

You might want to define a schema with circular ID references like:

convex/schema.ts

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from \"convex/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export default defineSchema({
  users: defineTable({
    preferencesId: v.id(\"preferences\"),
  }),
  preferences: defineTable({
    userId: v.id(\"users\"),
  }),
});

```

In this schema, documents in the `users` table contain a reference to documents
in `preferences` and vice versa.

Because schema validation enforces your schema on every `db.insert`,
`db.replace`, and `db.patch` call, creating circular references like this is not
possible.

The easiest way around this is to make one of the references nullable:

convex/schema.ts

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from \"convex/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export default defineSchema({
  users: defineTable({
    preferencesId: v.id(\"preferences\"),
  }),
  preferences: defineTable({
    userId: v.union(v.id(\"users\"), v.null()),
  }),
});

```

This way you can create a preferences document first, then create a user
document, then set the reference on the preferences document:

convex/users.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";

export default mutation(async (ctx) => {
  const preferencesId = await ctx.db.insert(\"preferences\", {});
  const userId = await ctx.db.insert(\"users\", { preferencesId });
  await ctx.db.patch(preferencesId, { userId });
});

```

[Let us know](https://docs.convex.dev/production/contact) if you need better support for
circular references.

## TypeScript types [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#typescript-types \"Direct link to TypeScript types\")

Once you've defined a schema,
[`npx convex dev`](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#run-the-convex-dev-server) will produce new
versions of [`dataModel.d.ts`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/data-model) and
[`server.d.ts`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server) with types based on your schema.

### `Doc<TableName>` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#doctablename \"Direct link to doctablename\")

The [`Doc`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/data-model#document) TypeScript type from
[`dataModel.d.ts`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/data-model) provides document types for all of
your tables. You can use these both when writing Convex functions and in your
React components:

MessageView.tsx

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { Doc } from \"../convex/_generated/dataModel\";

function MessageView(props: { message: Doc<\"messages\"> }) {
  ...
}

```

If you need the type for a portion of a document, use the
[`Infer` type helper](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation#extracting-typescript-types).

### `query` and `mutation` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas\\#query-and-mutation \"Direct link to query-and-mutation\")

The [`query`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server#query) and
[`mutation`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server#mutation) functions in
[`server.js`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/server) have the same API as before but now provide
a `db` with more precise types. Functions like
[`db.insert(table, document)`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericDatabaseWriter#insert)
now understand your schema. Additionally
[database queries](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/) will now return
the correct document type (not `any`).

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/production#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

Convex is built to serve live, production app traffic. Here we cover how to
deploy and maintain a production version of your app.

## Project management [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production\\#project-management \"Direct link to Project management\")

When you sign up for Convex, a Convex team is created for you. You can
[create more teams from the dashboard](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/teams) and add other
people to them as members. You can upgrade your team to the
[Pro plan](https://www.convex.dev/plans) for additional features, higher limits
and usage-based pricing.

Each team can have multiple projects. When you run `npx convex dev` for the
first time, a project is created for you automatically. You can also create a
project from the dashboard.

Every project has one shared production deployment and one development
deployment per team member. This allows each team member to make and test
changes independently before they are deployed to the production deployment.

Usually all deployments belonging to a single project run the same code base (or
a version of it), but Convex doesn't enforce this. You can also run the same
code base on multiple different prod deployments belonging to different
projects, see [staging](https://docs.convex.dev/production#staging-environment) below.

## Deploying to production [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production\\#deploying-to-production \"Direct link to Deploying to production\")

Your Convex deployments run your backend logic and in most cases you will also
develop a client that uses the backend. If your client is a web app, follow the
[Hosting and Deployment](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/) guide, to learn
how to deploy your client and your Convex backend together.

You can also deploy your backend on its own. Check out the
[Project Configuration](https://docs.convex.dev/production/project-configuration) page to
learn more.

## Staging environment [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production\\#staging-environment \"Direct link to Staging environment\")

With Convex
[preview deployments](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/preview-deployments) your
team can test out changes before deploying them to production. If you need a
more permanent staging environment, you can use a separate Convex project, and
deploy to it by setting the `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` environment variable when
running
[`npx convex deploy`](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#deploy-convex-functions-to-production).

## Typical team development workflow [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production\\#typical-team-development-workflow \"Direct link to Typical team development workflow\")

Teams developing on Convex usually follow this workflow:

1. If this is the team's first project, one team member creates a team on the
dashboard.
2. One team member creates a project by running `npx convex dev`, perhaps
starting with a [quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstarts) or a
[template](https://www.convex.dev/templates).
3. The team member creates a Git repository from the initial code and shares it
with their team (via GitHub, GitLab etc.).
4. Other team members pull the codebase, and get their own dev deployments by
running `npx convex dev`.
5. All team members can make backend changes and test them out with their
individual dev deployments. When a change is ready the team member opens a
pull-request (or commits to a shared branch).
   - [Backup / Restore](https://database/backup-restore) can be used to populate a dev
     deployment with data from a prod deployment.
   - [Data import](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/import) can be used to populate a
     dev deployment with synthetic seed data.
   - Members of a team with the [Pro plan](https://www.convex.dev/plans) can get
     separate
     [preview deployments](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/preview-deployments) to
     test each other's pull-requests.
6. Deployment to production can happen
[automatically](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/) when changes get merged
to the designated branch (say `main`).   - Alternatively one of the team members can deploy to production manually by
        running `npx convex deploy`.

### Making safe changes [​](https://docs.convex.dev/production\\#making-safe-changes \"Direct link to Making safe changes\")

Especially if your app is live you want to make sure that changes you make to
your Convex codebase do not break it.

Some unsafe changes are handled and caught by Convex, but others you need handle
yourself.

1. **Schema must always match existing data.** Convex enforces this constraint.
You cannot push a schema to a deployment with existing data that doesn't
match it, unless you turn off schema enforcement. In general it safe to:
1. Add new tables to the schema.
2. Add an `optional` field to an existing table's schema, set the field on
      all documents in the table, and then make the field required.
3. Mark an existing field as `optional`, remove the field from all documents,
      and then remove the field.
4. Mark an existing field as a `union` of the existing type and a new type,
      modify the field on all documents to match the new type, and then change
      the type to the new type.
2. **Functions should be backwards compatible.** Even if your only client is a
website, and you deploy it together with your backend, your users might still
be running the old version of your website when your backend changes.
Therefore you should make your functions backwards compatible until you are
OK to break old clients. In general it is safe to:
1. Add new functions.
2. Add an `optional` named argument to an existing function.
3. Mark an existing named argument as `optional`.
4. Mark an existing named argument as a `union` of the existing type and a
      new type.
5. Change the behavior of the function in such a way that given the arguments
      from an old client its behavior will still be acceptable to the old
      client.
3. **Scheduled functions should be backwards compatible.** When you schedule a
function to run in the future, you provide the argument values it will
receive. Whenever a function runs, it always runs its currently deployed
version. If you change the function between the time it was scheduled and the
time it runs, you must ensure the new version will behave acceptably given
the old arguments.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/svelte#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

Learn how to query data from Convex in a Svelte app.

01. Create a SvelteKit app



    Create a SvelteKit app using the `npx create svelte@latest` command.



    Other sets of options will work with the library as long as Svelte 5 is used but for this quickstart guide:



- For \"Which Svelte app template,\" choose **\"Skeleton project.\"**
- For \"Add type checking with TypeScript,\" choose **\"Yes, using TypeScript syntax.\"**
- For \"Select additional options,\" enable **\"Try the Svelte 5 preview.\"**

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm create svelte@latest my-app

```

02. Install the Convex client and server library



    To get started, install the `convex` and `convex-svelte` packages.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    cd my-app && npm install convex convex-svelte

    ```

03. Customize the convex path



    SvelteKit doesn't like referencing code outside of source, so customize
    the convex functionsDir to be under `src/`.









    convex.json





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    {
    	\"functions\": \"src/convex/\"
    }

    ```

04. Set up a Convex dev deployment



    Next, run `npx convex dev`. This
    will prompt you to log in with GitHub,
    create a project, and save your production and deployment URLs.



    It will also create a `convex/` folder for you
    to write your backend API functions in. The `dev` command
    will then continue running to sync your functions
    with your dev deployment in the cloud.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex dev

    ```

05. Create sample data for your database



    In a new terminal window, create a `sampleData.jsonl`
    file with some sample data.









    sampleData.jsonl





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    {\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

    ```

06. Add the sample data to your database



    Now that your project is ready, add a `tasks` table
    with the sample data into your Convex database with
    the `import` command.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

    ```

07. Expose a database query



    Add a new file `tasks.ts` in the `convex/` folder
    with a query function that loads the data.



    Exporting a query function from this file
    declares an API function named after the file
    and the export name, `api.tasks.get`.









    convex/tasks.ts





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

    export const get = query({
      args: {},
      handler: async (ctx) => {
        const tasks = await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
        return tasks.map((task) => ({ ...task, assigner: \"tom\" }));
      },
    });

    ```

08. Set up Convex



    Create a new file `src/routes/+layout.svelte` and set up the Convex client there to make it available on every page of your app.









    src/routes/+layout.svelte





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    <script lang=\"ts\">
    	import { PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL } from '$env/static/public';
    	import { setupConvex } from 'convex-svelte';

    	const { children } = $props();
    	setupConvex(PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL);
    </script>

    {@render children()}

    ```

09. Display the data in your app



    In `src/routes/+page.svelte` use `useQuery` to subscribe your `api.tasks.get`
    API function.









    src/routes/page.tsx





    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    <script lang=\"ts\">
    	import { useQuery } from 'convex-svelte';
    	import { api } from '../convex/_generated/api.js';

    	const query = useQuery(api.tasks.get, {});
    </script>

    {#if query.isLoading}
    	Loading...
    {:else if query.error}
    	failed to load: {query.error.toString()}
    {:else}
    	<ul>
    		{#each query.data as task}
    			<li>
    				{task.isCompleted ? '☑' : '☐'}
    				<span>{task.text}</span>
    				<span>assigned by {task.assigner}</span>
    			</li>
    		{/each}
    	</ul>
    {/if}

    ```

10. Start the app



    Start the app, open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) in a browser,
    and see the list of tasks.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npm run dev

The easiest way to publish your full-stack web app is to use a hosting provider
like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).

Both Vercel and Netlify integrate with Git to deploy code whenever a new
revision is pushed. To host your app:

1. Commit all files and push to your favorite Git hosting provider such as
[GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

2. Follow the appropriate guide below.


If you aren't using Netlify or Vercel, you can follow the Custom Hosting guide.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

Convex allows you to schedule functions to run on a recurring basis. For
example, cron jobs can be used to clean up data at a regular interval, send a
reminder email at the same time every month, or schedule a backup every
Saturday.

**Example:** [Cron Jobs](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/cron-jobs)

## Defining your cron jobs [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs\\#defining-your-cron-jobs \"Direct link to Defining your cron jobs\")

Cron jobs are defined in a `crons.ts` file in your `convex/` directory and look
like:

convex/crons.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { cronJobs } from \"convex/server\";
import { internal } from \"./_generated/api\";

const crons = cronJobs();

crons.interval(
  \"clear messages table\",
  { minutes: 1 }, // every minute
  internal.messages.clearAll,
);

crons.monthly(
  \"payment reminder\",
  { day: 1, hourUTC: 16, minuteUTC: 0 }, // Every month on the first day at 8:00am PST
  internal.payments.sendPaymentEmail,
  { email: \"my_email@gmail.com\" }, // argument to sendPaymentEmail
);

// An alternative way to create the same schedule as above with cron syntax
crons.cron(
  \"payment reminder duplicate\",
  \"0 16 1 * *\",
  internal.payments.sendPaymentEmail,
  { email: \"my_email@gmail.com\" }, // argument to sendPaymentEmail
);

export default crons;

```

The first argument is a unique identifier for the cron job.

The second argument is the schedule at which the function should run, see
[Supported schedules](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs#supported-schedules) below.

The third argument is the name of the public function or
[internal function](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/internal-functions), either a
[mutation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) or an
[action](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions).

## Supported schedules [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs\\#supported-schedules \"Direct link to Supported schedules\")

- [`crons.interval()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/server.Crons#interval) runs a function every
specified number of `seconds`, `minutes`, or `hours`. The first run occurs
when the cron job is first deployed to Convex. Unlike traditional crons, this
option allows you to have seconds-level granularity.
- [`crons.cron()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/server.Crons#cron) the traditional way of
specifying cron jobs by a string with five fields separated by spaces
(e.g. `\"* * * * *\"`). Times in cron syntax are in the UTC
timezone. [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/) is a helpful resource for
understanding and creating schedules in this format.
- [`crons.hourly()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/server.Crons#cron),
[`crons.daily()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/server.Crons#daily),
[`crons.weekly()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/server.Crons#weekly),
[`crons.monthly()`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/server.Crons#monthly) provide an alternative
syntax for common cron schedules with explicitly named arguments.

## Viewing your cron jobs [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs\\#viewing-your-cron-jobs \"Direct link to Viewing your cron jobs\")

You can view all your cron jobs in the
[Convex dashboard cron jobs view](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/schedules#cron-jobs-ui).
You can view added, updated, and deleted cron jobs in the logs and history view.
Results of previously executed runs of the cron jobs are also available in the
logs view.

## Error handling [​](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs\\#error-handling \"Direct link to Error handling\")

Mutations and actions have the same guarantees that are described in
[Error handling](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions#error-handling) for
scheduled functions.

At most one run of each cron job can be executing at any moment. If the function
scheduled by the cron job takes too long to run, following runs of the cron job
may be skipped to avoid execution from falling behind. Skipping a scheduled run
of a cron job due to the previous run still executing logs a message visible in
the logs view of the dashboard.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

Vector search allows you to find Convex documents similar to a provided vector.
Typically, vectors will be embeddings which are numerical representations of
text, images, or audio.

Embeddings and vector search enable you to provide useful context to LLMs for AI
powered applications, recommendations for similar content and more.

Vector search is consistent and fully up-to-date. You can write a vector and
immediately read it from a vector search. Unlike
[full text search](https://docs.convex.dev/search), however, vector search is only available
in [Convex actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions).

**Example:** [Vector Search App](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/vector-search)

To use vector search you need to:

1. Define a vector index.
2. Run a vector search from within an [action](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions).

## Defining vector indexes [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search\\#defining-vector-indexes \"Direct link to Defining vector indexes\")

Like [database indexes](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/), vector
indexes are a data structure that is built in advance to enable efficient
querying. Vector indexes are defined as part of your Convex
[schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas).

To add a vector index onto a table, use the
[`vectorIndex`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/server.TableDefinition#vectorindex) method on your
table's schema. Every vector index has a unique name and a definition with:

1. `vectorField` string
   - The name of the field indexed for vector search.
2. `dimensions` number
   - The fixed size of the vectors index. If you're using embeddings, this
     dimension should match the size of your embeddings (e.g. `1536` for
     OpenAI).
3. \\[Optional\\] `filterFields` array
   - The names of additional fields that are indexed for fast filtering within
     your vector index.

For example, if you want an index that can search for similar foods within a
given cuisine, your table definition could look like:

convex/schema.ts

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
foods: defineTable({
  description: v.string(),
  cuisine: v.string(),
  embedding: v.array(v.float64()),
}).vectorIndex(\"by_embedding\", {
  vectorField: \"embedding\",
  dimensions: 1536,
  filterFields: [\"cuisine\"],
}),

```

You can specify vector and filter fields on nested documents by using a
dot-separated path like `properties.name`.

## Running vector searches [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search\\#running-vector-searches \"Direct link to Running vector searches\")

Unlike database queries or full text search, vector searches can only be
performed in a [Convex action](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions).

They generally involve three steps:

1. Generate a vector from provided input (e.g. using OpenAI)
2. Use
[`ctx.vectorSearch`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericActionCtx#vectorsearch) to
fetch the IDs of similar documents
3. Load the desired information for the documents

Here's an example of the first two steps for searching for similar French foods
based on a description:

convex/foods.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { v } from \"convex/values\";
import { action } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const similarFoods = action({
  args: {
    descriptionQuery: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // 1. Generate an embedding from you favorite third party API:
    const embedding = await embed(args.descriptionQuery);
    // 2. Then search for similar foods!
    const results = await ctx.vectorSearch(\"foods\", \"by_embedding\", {
      vector: embedding,
      limit: 16,
      filter: (q) => q.eq(\"cuisine\", \"French\"),
    });
    // ...
  },
});

```

An example of the first step can be found
[here](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/blob/main/vector-search/convex/foods.ts#L18)
in the vector search demo app.

Focusing on the second step, the `vectorSearch` API takes in the table name, the
index name, and finally a
[`VectorSearchQuery`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.VectorSearchQuery) object
describing the search. This object has the following fields:

1. `vector` array
   - An array of numbers (e.g. embedding) to use in the search.
   - The search will return the document IDs of the documents with the most
     similar stored vectors.
   - It must have the same length as the `dimensions` of the index.
2. \\[Optional\\] `limit` number
   - The number of results to get back. If specified, this value must be between
     1 and 256.
3. \\[Optional\\] `filter`
   - An expression that restricts the set of results based on the `filterFields`
     in the `vectorIndex` in your schema. See
     [Filter expressions](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search#filter-expressions) for details.

It returns an `Array` of objects containing exactly two fields:

1. `_id`
   - The [Document ID](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids) for the
     matching document in the table
2. `_score`
   - An indicator of how similar the result is to the vector you were searching
     for, ranging from -1 (least similar) to 1 (most similar)

Neither the underlying document nor the vector are included in `results`, so
once you have the list of results, you will want to load the desired information
about the results.

There are a few strategies for loading this information documented in the
[Advanced Patterns](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search#advanced-patterns) section.

For now, let's load the documents and return them from the action. To do so,
we'll pass the list of results to a Convex query and run it inside of our
action, returning the result:

convex/foods.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const fetchResults = internalQuery({
  args: { ids: v.array(v.id(\"foods\")) },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const results = [];
    for (const id of args.ids) {
      const doc = await ctx.db.get(id);
      if (doc === null) {
        continue;
      }
      results.push(doc);
    }
    return results;
  },
});

```

convex/foods.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const similarFoods = action({
  args: {
    descriptionQuery: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // 1. Generate an embedding from you favorite third party API:
    const embedding = await embed(args.descriptionQuery);
    // 2. Then search for similar foods!
    const results = await ctx.vectorSearch(\"foods\", \"by_embedding\", {
      vector: embedding,
      limit: 16,
      filter: (q) => q.eq(\"cuisine\", \"French\"),
    });
    // 3. Fetch the results
    const foods: Array<Doc<\"foods\">> = await ctx.runQuery(
      internal.foods.fetchResults,
      { ids: results.map((result) => result._id) },
    );
    return foods;
  },
});

```

### Filter expressions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search\\#filter-expressions \"Direct link to Filter expressions\")

As mentioned above, vector searches support efficiently filtering results by
additional fields on your document using either exact equality on a single
field, or an `OR` of expressions.

For example, here's a filter for foods with cuisine exactly equal to \"French\":

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
filter: (q) => q.eq(\"cuisine\", \"French\"),

```

You can also filter documents by a single field that contains several different
values using an `or` expression. Here's a filter for French or Indonesian
dishes:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
filter: (q) =>
  q.or(q.eq(\"cuisine\", \"French\"), q.eq(\"cuisine\", \"Indonesian\")),

```

For indexes with multiple filter fields, you can also use `.or()` filters on
different fields. Here's a filter for dishes whose cuisine is French or whose
main ingredient is butter:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
filter: (q) =>
  q.or(q.eq(\"cuisine\", \"French\"), q.eq(\"mainIngredient\", \"butter\")),

```

**Both `cuisine` and `mainIngredient` would need to be included in the**
**`filterFields` in the `.vectorIndex` definition.**

### Other filtering [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search\\#other-filtering \"Direct link to Other filtering\")

Results can be filtered based on how similar they are to the provided vector
using the `_score` field in your action:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const results = await ctx.vectorSearch(\"foods\", \"by_embedding\", {
  vector: embedding,
});
const filteredResults = results.filter((result) => result._score >= 0.9);

```

Additional filtering can always be done by passing the vector search results to
a query or mutation function that loads the documents and performs filtering
using any of the fields on the document.

**For performance, always put as many of your filters as possible into**
**`.vectorSearch`.**

### Ordering [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search\\#ordering \"Direct link to Ordering\")

Vector queries always return results in relevance order.

Currently Convex searches vectors using an
[approximate nearest neighbor search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search#Approximate_nearest_neighbor)
based on [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).
Support for more similarity metrics [will come in the future](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search#coming-soon).

If multiple documents have the same score, ties are broken by the document ID.

## Advanced patterns [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search\\#advanced-patterns \"Direct link to Advanced patterns\")

### Using a separate table to store vectors [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search\\#using-a-separate-table-to-store-vectors \"Direct link to Using a separate table to store vectors\")

There are two main options for setting up a vector index:

1. Storing vectors in the same table as other metadata
2. Storing vectors in a separate table, with a reference

The examples above show the first option, which is simpler and works well for
reading small amounts of documents. The second option is more complex, but
better supports reading or returning large amounts of documents.

Since vectors are typically large and not useful beyond performing vector
searches, it's nice to avoid loading them from the database when reading other
data (e.g. `db.get()`) or returning them from functions by storing them in a
separate table.

A table definition for movies, and a vector index supporting search for similar
movies filtering by genre would look like this:

convex/schema.ts

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
movieEmbeddings: defineTable({
  embedding: v.array(v.float64()),
  genre: v.string(),
}).vectorIndex(\"by_embedding\", {
  vectorField: \"embedding\",
  dimensions: 1536,
  filterFields: [\"genre\"],
}),
movies: defineTable({
  title: v.string(),
  genre: v.string(),
  description: v.string(),
  votes: v.number(),
  embeddingId: v.optional(v.id(\"movieEmbeddings\")),
}).index(\"by_embedding\", [\"embeddingId\"]),

```

Generating an embedding and running a vector search are the same as using a
single table. Loading the relevant documents given the vector search result is
different since we have an ID for `movieEmbeddings` but want to load a `movies`
document. We can do this using the `by_embedding` database index on the `movies`
table:

convex/movies.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const fetchMovies = query({
  args: {
    ids: v.array(v.id(\"movieEmbeddings\")),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const results = [];
    for (const id of args.ids) {
      const doc = await ctx.db
        .query(\"movies\")
        .withIndex(\"by_embedding\", (q) => q.eq(\"embeddingId\", id))
        .unique();
      if (doc === null) {
        continue;
      }
      results.push(doc);
    }
    return results;
  },
});

```

### Fetching results and adding new documents [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search\\#fetching-results-and-adding-new-documents \"Direct link to Fetching results and adding new documents\")

Returning information from a vector search involves an action (since vector
search is only available in actions) and a query or mutation to load the data.

The example above used a query to load data and return it from an action. Since
this is an action, the data returned is not reactive. An alternative would be to
return the results of the vector search in the action, and have a separate query
that reactively loads the data. The search results will not update reactively,
but the data about each result would be reactive.

The
[Vector Search Demo App](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/vector-search)
uses this strategy to show similar movies with a reactive \"Votes\" count.

## Limits [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search\\#limits \"Direct link to Limits\")

Convex supports millions of vectors today. This is an ongoing project and we
will continue to scale this offering out with the rest of Convex.

Vector indexes must have:

- Exactly 1 vector index field.
  - The field must be of type `v.array(v.float64())` (or a union in which one of
    the possible types is `v.array(v.float64())`)
- Exactly 1 dimension field with a value between 2 and 4096.
- Up to 16 filter fields.

Vector indexes count towards the
[limit of 32 indexes per table](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/#limits).
In addition you can have up to 4 vector indexes per table.

Vector searches can have:

- Exactly 1 vector to search by in the `vector` field
- Up to 64 filter expressions
- Up to 256 requested results (defaulting to 10).

If your action performs a vector search then passes the results to a query or
mutation function, you may find that one or more results from the vector search
have been deleted or mutated. Because vector search is only available in
actions, you cannot perform additional transactional queries or mutations based
on the results. If this is important for your use case, please
[let us know on Discord](https://convex.dev/community)!

Only documents that contain a vector of the size and in the field specified by a
vector index will be included in the index and returned by the vector search.

For information on limits, see [here](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits).

## Future development [​](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search\\#future-development \"Direct link to Future development\")

We're always open to customer feedback and requests. Some ideas we've considered
for improving vector search in Convex include:

- More sophisticated filters and filter syntax
- Filtering by score in the `vectorSearch` API
- Better support for generating embeddings

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/debugging#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

Debugging is the process of figuring out why your code isn't behaving as you
expect.

## Debugging during development [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/debugging\\#debugging-during-development \"Direct link to Debugging during development\")

During development the built-in `console` API allows you to understand what's
going on inside your functions:

convex/myFunctions.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const mutateSomething = mutation({
  args: { a: v.number(), b: v.number() },
  handler: (_, args) => {
    console.log(\"Received args\", args);
    // ...
  },
});

```

The following methods are available in the
[default Convex runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#default-convex-runtime):

- Logging values, with a specified severity level:
  - `console.log`
  - `console.info`
  - `console.warn`
  - `console.error`
  - `console.debug`
- Logging with a stack trace:
  - [`console.trace`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/trace_static)
- Measuring execution time:
  - [`console.time`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/time_static)
  - [`console.timeLog`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/timelog_static)
  - [`console.timeEnd`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/timeend_static)

The Convex backend also automatically logs all successful function executions
and all errors thrown by your functions.

You can view these logs:

1. When using the [`ConvexReactClient`](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react), in your browser
developer tools console pane. The logs are sent from your dev deployment to
your client, and the client logs them to the browser. Production deployments
[**do not** send logs to the client](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/#differences-in-error-reporting-between-dev-and-prod).
2. In your Convex dashboard on the
[Logs page](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/logs).
3. In your terminal by running
[`npx convex logs`](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#tail-deployment-logs) or
`npx convex dev --tail-logs`.

### Using a debugger [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/debugging\\#using-a-debugger \"Direct link to Using a debugger\")

You can exercise your functions from tests, in which case you can add
`debugger;` statements and step through your code. See
[Testing](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test#debugging-tests).

## Debugging in production [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/debugging\\#debugging-in-production \"Direct link to Debugging in production\")

When debugging an issue in production your options are:

1. Leverage existing logging
2. Add more logging and deploy a new version of your backend to production

Convex backend currently only preserves a limited number of logs, and logs can
be erased at any time when the Convex team performs internal maintenance and
upgrades. You should therefore set up
[log streaming and error reporting](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/)
integrations to enable your team easy access to historical logs and additional
information logged by your client.

## Finding relevant logs by Request ID [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/debugging\\#finding-relevant-logs-by-request-id \"Direct link to Finding relevant logs by Request ID\")

To find the appropriate logs for an error you or your users experience, Convex
includes a Request ID in all exception messages in both dev and prod in this
format: `[Request ID: <request_id>]`.

You can copy and paste a Request ID into your Convex dashboard to view the logs
for functions started by that request. See the
[Dashboard logs page](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/logs#filter-logs) for
details.

On this page

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React web development framework. When used
with Convex, Next.js provides:

- File-system based routing
- Fast refresh in development
- Font and image optimization

and more!

This page covers the App Router variant of Next.js. Alternatively see the
[Pages Router](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs-pages-router/nextjs-pages-router)
version of this page.

## Getting started [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs\\#getting-started \"Direct link to Getting started\")

Follow the [Next.js Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/nextjs) to add Convex to a
new or existing Next.js project.

## Adding authentication [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs\\#adding-authentication \"Direct link to Adding authentication\")

### Client-side only [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs\\#client-side-only \"Direct link to Client-side only\")

The simplest way to add user authentication to your Next.js app is to follow our
React-based authentication guides for [Clerk](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk) or
[Auth0](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/auth0), inside your `app/ConvexClientProvider.tsx` file.
For example this is what the file would look like for Auth0:

app/ConvexClientProvider.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
\"use client\";

import { Auth0Provider } from \"@auth0/auth0-react\";
import { ConvexReactClient } from \"convex/react\";
import { ConvexProviderWithAuth0 } from \"convex/react-auth0\";
import { ReactNode } from \"react\";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL!);

export function ConvexClientProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <Auth0Provider
      domain={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN!}
      clientId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID!}
      authorizationParams={{
        redirect_uri:
          typeof window === \"undefined\" ? undefined : window.location.origin,
      }}
      useRefreshTokens={true}
      cacheLocation=\"localstorage\"
    >
      <ConvexProviderWithAuth0 client={convex}>
        {children}
      </ConvexProviderWithAuth0>
    </Auth0Provider>
  );
}

```

Custom loading and logged out views can be built with the helper
`Authenticated`, `Unauthenticated` and `AuthLoading` components from
`convex/react`, see the
[Convex Next.js demo](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/nextjs-pages-router/pages/_app.tsx)
for an example.

If only some routes of your app require login, the same helpers can be used
directly in page components that do require login instead of being shared
between all pages from `app/ConvexClientProvider.tsx`. Share a single
[ConvexReactClient](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/react.ConvexReactClient) instance between pages
to avoid needing to reconnect to Convex on client-side page navigation.

### Server and client side [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs\\#server-and-client-side \"Direct link to Server and client side\")

To access user information or load Convex data requiring `ctx.auth` from Server
Components, Server Actions, or Route Handlers you need to use the Next.js
specific SDKs provided by Clerk and Auth0.

Additional `.env.local` configuration is needed for these hybrid SDKs.

#### Clerk [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs\\#clerk \"Direct link to Clerk\")

For an example of using Convex and with Next.js 15, run

**`npm create convex@latest -- -t nextjs-clerk`**

**``**

Otherwise, follow the
[Clerk Next.js quickstart](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs), a guide
from Clerk that includes steps for adding `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` to the .env.local file. In Next.js 15, the
`<ClerkProvider>` component imported from the `@clerk/nextjs` v6 package
functions as both a client and a server context provider so you probably won't
need the `ClerkProvider` from `@clerk/clerk-react`.

#### Auth0 [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs\\#auth0 \"Direct link to Auth0\")

See the
[Auth0 Next.js](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/01-login) guide.

#### Other providers [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs\\#other-providers \"Direct link to Other providers\")

Convex uses JWT identity tokens on the client for live query subscriptions and
running mutations and actions, and on the Next.js backend for running queries,
mutations, and actions in server components and API routes.

Obtain the appropriate OpenID Identity JWT in both locations and you should be
able to use any auth provider. See
[Custom Auth](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/advanced/custom-auth) for more.

## Server rendering (SSR) [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react/nextjs\\#server-rendering-ssr \"Direct link to Server rendering (SSR)\")

Next.js automatically renders both Client and Server Components on the server
during the initial page load.

To keep your UI
[automatically reactive](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#caching-reactivity)
to changes in your Convex database it needs to use Client Components. The
`ConvexReactClient` will maintain a connection to your deployment and will get
updates as data changes and that must happen on the client.

See the dedicated
[Server Rendering](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#caching-reactivity) page
for more details about preloading data for Client Components, fetching data and
authentication in Server Components, and implementing Route Handlers.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

_If you're using [Convex Auth](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/convex-auth) the user information_
_is already stored in your database. There's nothing else you need to implement._

You might want to store user information directly in your Convex database, for
the following reasons:

- Your functions need information about other users, not just about the
currently logged-in user
- Your functions need access to information other than the fields available in
the [Open ID Connect JWT](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/functions-auth)

There are two ways you can choose from for storing user information in your
database (but only the second one allows storing information not contained in
the JWT):

1. Have your app's [client call a mutation](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth#call-a-mutation-from-the-client)
that stores the information from the JWT available on
[`ctx.auth`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.Auth)
2. [Implement a webhook](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth#set-up-webhooks) and have your identity provider call
it whenever user information changes

## Call a mutation from the client [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#call-a-mutation-from-the-client \"Direct link to Call a mutation from the client\")

**Example:** [Convex Authentication with Clerk](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/users-and-clerk)

### (optional) Users table schema [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#optional-users-table-schema \"Direct link to (optional) Users table schema\")

You can define a `\"users\"` table, optionally with an
[index](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/) for efficient looking up
the users in the database.

In the examples below we will use the `tokenIdentifier` from the
`ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` to identify the user, but you could use the
`subject` field (which is usually set to the unique user ID from your auth
provider) or even `email`, if your authentication provider provides email
verification and you have it enabled.

Which field you use will determine how multiple providers interact, and how hard
it will be to migrate to a different provider.

convex/schema.ts

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
users: defineTable({
  name: v.string(),
  tokenIdentifier: v.string(),
}).index(\"by_token\", [\"tokenIdentifier\"]),

```

### Mutation for storing current user [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#mutation-for-storing-current-user \"Direct link to Mutation for storing current user\")

This is an example of a mutation that stores the user's `name` and
`tokenIdentifier`:

convex/users.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const store = mutation({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) {
      throw new Error(\"Called storeUser without authentication present\");
    }

    // Check if we've already stored this identity before.
    // Note: If you don't want to define an index right away, you can use
    // ctx.db.query(\"users\")
    //  .filter(q => q.eq(q.field(\"tokenIdentifier\"), identity.tokenIdentifier))
    //  .unique();
    const user = await ctx.db
      .query(\"users\")
      .withIndex(\"by_token\", (q) =>
        q.eq(\"tokenIdentifier\", identity.tokenIdentifier),
      )
      .unique();
    if (user !== null) {
      // If we've seen this identity before but the name has changed, patch the value.
      if (user.name !== identity.name) {
        await ctx.db.patch(user._id, { name: identity.name });
      }
      return user._id;
    }
    // If it's a new identity, create a new `User`.
    return await ctx.db.insert(\"users\", {
      name: identity.name ?? \"Anonymous\",
      tokenIdentifier: identity.tokenIdentifier,
    });
  },
});

```

### Calling the store user mutation from React [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#calling-the-store-user-mutation-from-react \"Direct link to Calling the store user mutation from React\")

You can call this mutation when the user logs in from a `useEffect` hook. After
the mutation succeeds you can update local state to reflect that the user has
been stored.

This helper hook that does the job:

src/useStoreUserEffect.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useUser } from \"@clerk/clerk-react\";
import { useConvexAuth } from \"convex/react\";
import { useEffect, useState } from \"react\";
import { useMutation } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";
import { Id } from \"../convex/_generated/dataModel\";

export function useStoreUserEffect() {
  const { isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useConvexAuth();
  const { user } = useUser();
  // When this state is set we know the server
  // has stored the user.
  const [userId, setUserId] = useState<Id<\"users\"> | null>(null);
  const storeUser = useMutation(api.users.store);
  // Call the `storeUser` mutation function to store
  // the current user in the `users` table and return the `Id` value.
  useEffect(() => {
    // If the user is not logged in don't do anything
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      return;
    }
    // Store the user in the database.
    // Recall that `storeUser` gets the user information via the `auth`
    // object on the server. You don't need to pass anything manually here.
    async function createUser() {
      const id = await storeUser();
      setUserId(id);
    }
    createUser();
    return () => setUserId(null);
    // Make sure the effect reruns if the user logs in with
    // a different identity
  }, [isAuthenticated, storeUser, user?.id]);
  // Combine the local state with the state from context
  return {
    isLoading: isLoading || (isAuthenticated && userId === null),
    isAuthenticated: isAuthenticated && userId !== null,
  };
}

```

You can use this hook in your top-level component. If your queries need the user
document to be present, make sure that you only render the components that call
them after the user has been stored:

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { SignInButton, UserButton } from \"@clerk/clerk-react\";
import { useQuery } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";
import { useStoreUserEffect } from \"./useStoreUserEffect.js\";

function App() {
  const { isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useStoreUserEffect();
  return (
    <main>
      {isLoading ? (
        <>Loading...</>
      ) : !isAuthenticated ? (
        <SignInButton />
      ) : (
        <>
          <UserButton />
          <Content />
        </>
      )}
    </main>
  );
}

function Content() {
  const messages = useQuery(api.messages.getForCurrentUser);
  return <div>Authenticated content: {messages?.length}</div>;
}

export default App;

```

In this way the `useStoreUserEffect` hook replaces the `useConvexAuth` hook.

### Using the current user's document ID [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#using-the-current-users-document-id \"Direct link to Using the current user's document ID\")

Similarly to the store user mutation, you can retrieve the current user's ID, or
throw an error if the user hasn't been stored.

Now that you have users stored as documents in your Convex database, you can use
their IDs as foreign keys in other documents:

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { v } from \"convex/values\";
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const send = mutation({
  args: { body: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (!identity) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthenticated call to mutation\");
    }
    const user = await ctx.db
      .query(\"users\")
      .withIndex(\"by_token\", (q) =>
        q.eq(\"tokenIdentifier\", identity.tokenIdentifier),
      )
      .unique();
    if (!user) {
      throw new Error(\"Unauthenticated call to mutation\");
    }
    await ctx.db.insert(\"messages\", { body: args.body, user: user._id });
  },
});
    // do something with `user`...
  }
});

```

### Loading users by their ID [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#loading-users-by-their-id \"Direct link to Loading users by their ID\")

The information about other users can be retrieved via their IDs:

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

export const list = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const messages = await ctx.db.query(\"messages\").collect();
    return Promise.all(
      messages.map(async (message) => {
        // For each message in this channel, fetch the `User` who wrote it and
        // insert their name into the `author` field.
        const user = await ctx.db.get(message.user);
        return {
          author: user?.name ?? \"Anonymous\",
          ...message,
        };
      }),
    );
  },
});

```

## Set up webhooks [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#set-up-webhooks \"Direct link to Set up webhooks\")

This guide will use Clerk, but Auth0 can be set up similarly via
[Auth0 Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/actions-overview).

With this implementation Clerk will call your Convex backend via an HTTP
endpoint any time a user signs up, updates or deletes their account.

**Example:** [Convex Authentication with Clerk and Webhooks](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-demos/tree/main/users-and-clerk-webhooks)

### Configure the webhook endpoint in Clerk [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#configure-the-webhook-endpoint-in-clerk \"Direct link to Configure the webhook endpoint in Clerk\")

On your Clerk dashboard, go to _Webhooks_, click on _\\+ Add Endpoint_.

Set _Endpoint URL_ to
`https://<your deployment name>.convex.site/clerk-users-webhook` (note the
domain ends in **`.site`**, not `.cloud`). You can see your deployment name in
the `.env.local` file in your project directory, or on your Convex dashboard as
part of the [Deployment URL](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/deployment-settings). For
example, the endpoint URL could be:
`https://happy-horse-123.convex.site/clerk-users-webhook`.

In _Message Filtering_, select **user** for all user events (scroll down or use
the search input).

Click on _Create_.

After the endpoint is saved, copy the _Signing Secret_ (on the right side of the
UI), it should start with `whsec_`. Set it as the value of the
`CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable in your Convex
[dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/).

### (optional) Users table schema [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#optional-users-table-schema-1 \"Direct link to (optional) Users table schema\")

You can define a `\"users\"` table, optionally with an
[index](https://docs.convex.dev/database/reading-data/indexes/) for efficient looking up
the users in the database.

In the examples below we will use the `subject` from the
`ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` to identify the user, which should be set to the
Clerk user ID.

convex/schema.ts

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
users: defineTable({
  name: v.string(),
  // this the Clerk ID, stored in the subject JWT field
  externalId: v.string(),
}).index(\"byExternalId\", [\"externalId\"]),

```

### Mutations for upserting and deleting users [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#mutations-for-upserting-and-deleting-users \"Direct link to Mutations for upserting and deleting users\")

This is an example of mutations that handle the updates received via the
webhook:

convex/users.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { internalMutation, query, QueryCtx } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { UserJSON } from \"@clerk/backend\";
import { v, Validator } from \"convex/values\";

export const current = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return await getCurrentUser(ctx);
  },
});

export const upsertFromClerk = internalMutation({
  args: { data: v.any() as Validator<UserJSON> }, // no runtime validation, trust Clerk
  async handler(ctx, { data }) {
    const userAttributes = {
      name: `${data.first_name} ${data.last_name}`,
      externalId: data.id,
    };

    const user = await userByExternalId(ctx, data.id);
    if (user === null) {
      await ctx.db.insert(\"users\", userAttributes);
    } else {
      await ctx.db.patch(user._id, userAttributes);
    }
  },
});

export const deleteFromClerk = internalMutation({
  args: { clerkUserId: v.string() },
  async handler(ctx, { clerkUserId }) {
    const user = await userByExternalId(ctx, clerkUserId);

    if (user !== null) {
      await ctx.db.delete(user._id);
    } else {
      console.warn(
        `Can't delete user, there is none for Clerk user ID: ${clerkUserId}`,
      );
    }
  },
});

export async function getCurrentUserOrThrow(ctx: QueryCtx) {
  const userRecord = await getCurrentUser(ctx);
  if (!userRecord) throw new Error(\"Can't get current user\");
  return userRecord;
}

export async function getCurrentUser(ctx: QueryCtx) {
  const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
  if (identity === null) {
    return null;
  }
  return await userByExternalId(ctx, identity.subject);
}

async function userByExternalId(ctx: QueryCtx, externalId: string) {
  return await ctx.db
    .query(\"users\")
    .withIndex(\"byExternalId\", (q) => q.eq(\"externalId\", externalId))
    .unique();
}

```

There are also a few helpers in this file:

- `current` exposes the user information to the client, which will helps the
client determine whether the webhook already succeeded
- `upsertFromClerk` will be called when a user signs up or when they update
their account
- `deleteFromClerk` will be called when a user deletes their account via Clerk
UI from your app
- `getCurrentUserOrThrow` retrieves the currently logged-in user or throws an
error
- `getCurrentUser` retrieves the currently logged-in user or returns null
- `userByExternalId` retrieves a user given the Clerk ID, and is used only for
retrieving the current user or when updating an existing user via the webhook

### Webhook endpoint implementation [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#webhook-endpoint-implementation \"Direct link to Webhook endpoint implementation\")

This how the actual HTTP endpoint can be implemented:

convex/http.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { httpRouter } from \"convex/server\";
import { httpAction } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { internal } from \"./_generated/api\";
import type { WebhookEvent } from \"@clerk/backend\";
import { Webhook } from \"svix\";

const http = httpRouter();

http.route({
  path: \"/clerk-users-webhook\",
  method: \"POST\",
  handler: httpAction(async (ctx, request) => {
    const event = await validateRequest(request);
    if (!event) {
      return new Response(\"Error occured\", { status: 400 });
    }
    switch (event.type) {
      case \"user.created\": // intentional fallthrough
      case \"user.updated\":
        await ctx.runMutation(internal.users.upsertFromClerk, {
          data: event.data,
        });
        break;

      case \"user.deleted\": {
        const clerkUserId = event.data.id!;
        await ctx.runMutation(internal.users.deleteFromClerk, { clerkUserId });
        break;
      }
      default:
        console.log(\"Ignored Clerk webhook event\", event.type);
    }

    return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
  }),
});

async function validateRequest(req: Request): Promise<WebhookEvent | null> {
  const payloadString = await req.text();
  const svixHeaders = {
    \"svix-id\": req.headers.get(\"svix-id\")!,
    \"svix-timestamp\": req.headers.get(\"svix-timestamp\")!,
    \"svix-signature\": req.headers.get(\"svix-signature\")!,
  };
  const wh = new Webhook(process.env.CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET!);
  try {
    return wh.verify(payloadString, svixHeaders) as unknown as WebhookEvent;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(\"Error verifying webhook event\", error);
    return null;
  }
}

export default http;

```

If you deploy your code now and sign in, you should see the user being created
in your Convex database.

### Using the current user's document [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#using-the-current-users-document \"Direct link to Using the current user's document\")

You can use the helpers defined before to retrieve the current user's document.

Now that you have users stored as documents in your Convex database, you can use
their IDs as foreign keys in other documents:

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { v } from \"convex/values\";
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { getCurrentUserOrThrow } from \"./users\";

export const send = mutation({
  args: { body: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const user = await getCurrentUserOrThrow(ctx);
    await ctx.db.insert(\"messages\", { body: args.body, userId: user._id });
  },
});

```

### Loading users by their ID [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#loading-users-by-their-id-1 \"Direct link to Loading users by their ID\")

The information about other users can be retrieved via their IDs:

convex/messages.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const list = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const messages = await ctx.db.query(\"messages\").collect();
    return Promise.all(
      messages.map(async (message) => {
        // For each message in this channel, fetch the `User` who wrote it and
        // insert their name into the `author` field.
        const user = await ctx.db.get(message.user);
        return {
          author: user?.name ?? \"Anonymous\",
          ...message,
        };
      }),
    );
  },
});

```

### Waiting for current user to be stored [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/database-auth\\#waiting-for-current-user-to-be-stored \"Direct link to Waiting for current user to be stored\")

If you want to use the current user's document in a query, make sure that the
user has already been stored. You can do this by explicitly checking for this
condition before rendering the components that call the query, or before
redirecting to the authenticated portion of your app.

For example you can define a hook that determines the current authentication
state of the client, taking into account whether the current user has been
stored:

src/useCurrentUser.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useConvexAuth, useQuery } from \"convex/react\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function useCurrentUser() {
  const { isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useConvexAuth();
  const user = useQuery(api.users.current);
  // Combine the authentication state with the user existence check
  return {
    isLoading: isLoading || (isAuthenticated && user === null),
    isAuthenticated: isAuthenticated && user !== null,
  };
}

```

And then you can use it to render the appropriate components:

src/App.tsx

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useCurrentUser } from \"./useCurrentUser\";

export default function App() {
  const { isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useCurrentUser();
  return (
    <main>
      {isLoading ? (
        <>Loading...</>
      ) : isAuthenticated ? (
        <Content />
      ) : (
        <LoginPage />
      )}
    </main>
  );
}

  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const taskId = await ctx.db.insert(\"tasks\", { text: args.text });
    // do something with `taskId`
  },
});

```

The second argument to `db.insert` is a JavaScript object with data for the new
document.

The same types of values that can be passed into and returned from
[queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) and
[mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) can be written into the
database. See [Data Types](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types) for the full list of
supported types.

The `insert` method returns a globally unique ID for the newly inserted
document.

## Updating existing documents [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/writing-data\\#updating-existing-documents \"Direct link to Updating existing documents\")

Given an existing document ID the document can be updated using the following
methods:

1. The [`db.patch`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericDatabaseWriter#patch) method
will patch an existing document, shallow merging it with the given partial
document. New fields are added. Existing fields are overwritten. Fields set
to `undefined` are removed.

convex/tasks.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const updateTask = mutation({
  args: { id: v.id(\"tasks\") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const { id } = args;
    console.log(await ctx.db.get(id));
    // { text: \"foo\", status: { done: true }, _id: ... }

    // Add `tag` and overwrite `status`:
    await ctx.db.patch(id, { tag: \"bar\", status: { archived: true } });
    console.log(await ctx.db.get(id));
    // { text: \"foo\", tag: \"bar\", status: { archived: true }, _id: ... }

    // Unset `tag` by setting it to `undefined`
    await ctx.db.patch(id, { tag: undefined });
    console.log(await ctx.db.get(id));
    // { text: \"foo\", status: { archived: true }, _id: ... }
  },
});

```

2. The [`db.replace`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericDatabaseWriter#replace)
method will replace the existing document entirely, potentially removing
existing fields:

convex/tasks.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const replaceTask = mutation({
  args: { id: v.id(\"tasks\") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const { id } = args;
    console.log(await ctx.db.get(id));
    // { text: \"foo\", _id: ... }

    // Replace the whole document
    await ctx.db.replace(id, { invalid: true });
    console.log(await ctx.db.get(id));
    // { invalid: true, _id: ... }
  },
});

```

## Deleting documents [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/writing-data\\#deleting-documents \"Direct link to Deleting documents\")

Given an existing document ID the document can be removed from the table with
the [`db.delete`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.GenericDatabaseWriter#delete) method.

convex/tasks.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { mutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const deleteTask = mutation({
  args: { id: v.id(\"tasks\") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    await ctx.db.delete(args.id);
  },
});

```

## Write performance and limits [​](https://docs.convex.dev/database/writing-data\\#write-performance-and-limits \"Direct link to Write performance and limits\")

To prevent accidental writes of large amounts of records, queries and mutations
enforce limits detailed [here](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits#transactions).

[ConvexAuthState](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#convexauthstate) to descendants of this component.

Use this to integrate any auth provider with Convex. The `useAuth` prop
should be a React hook that returns the provider's authentication state
and a function to fetch a JWT access token.

If the `useAuth` prop function updates causing a rerender then auth state
wil transition to loading and the `fetchAccessToken()` function called again.

### usePaginatedQuery [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react\\#usepaginatedquery \"Direct link to usePaginatedQuery\")

▸ **usePaginatedQuery** < `Query` >( `query`, `args`, `options`): [`UsePaginatedQueryReturnType`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#usepaginatedqueryreturntype) < `Query` >

Load data reactively from a paginated query to a create a growing list.

This can be used to power \"infinite scroll\" UIs.

This hook must be used with public query references that match
[PaginatedQueryReference](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#paginatedqueryreference).

`usePaginatedQuery` concatenates all the pages of results into a single list
and manages the continuation cursors when requesting more items.

Example usage:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const { results, status, isLoading, loadMore } = usePaginatedQuery(
  api.messages.list,
  { channel: \"#general\" },
  { initialNumItems: 5 }
);

```

If the query reference or arguments change, the pagination state will be reset
to the first page. Similarly, if any of the pages result in an InvalidCursor
error or an error associated with too much data, the pagination state will also
reset to the first page.

To learn more about pagination, see [Paginated Queries](https://docs.convex.dev/database/pagination).

▸ **optimisticallyUpdateValueInPaginatedQuery** < `Query` >( `localStore`, `query`, `args`, `updateValue`): `void`

Optimistically update the values in a paginated list.

This optimistic update is designed to be used to update data loaded with
[usePaginatedQuery](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#usepaginatedquery). It updates the list by applying
`updateValue` to each element of the list across all of the loaded pages.

This will only apply to queries with a matching names and arguments.

Example usage:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const myMutation = useMutation(api.myModule.myMutation)
.withOptimisticUpdate((localStore, mutationArg) => {

  // Optimistically update the document with ID `mutationArg`
  // to have an additional property.

  optimisticallyUpdateValueInPaginatedQuery(
    localStore,
    api.myModule.paginatedQuery
    {},
    currentValue => {
      if (mutationArg === currentValue._id) {
        return {
          ...currentValue,

### useQueries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react\\#usequeries \"Direct link to useQueries\")

▸ **useQueries**( `queries`): `Record` < `string`, `any` \\| `undefined` \\| `Error` >

Load a variable number of reactive Convex queries.

`useQueries` is similar to [useQuery](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#usequery) but it allows
loading multiple queries which can be useful for loading a dynamic number
of queries without violating the rules of React hooks.

This hook accepts an object whose keys are identifiers for each query and the
values are objects of `{ query: FunctionReference, args: Record<string, Value> }`. The
`query` is a FunctionReference for the Convex query function to load, and the `args` are
the arguments to that function.

The hook returns an object that maps each identifier to the result of the query,
`undefined` if the query is still loading, or an instance of `Error` if the query
threw an exception.

For example if you loaded a query like:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const results = useQueries({
  messagesInGeneral: {
    query: \"listMessages\",
    args: { channel: \"#general\" }
  }
});

```

then the result would look like:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{
  messagesInGeneral: [{\\
    channel: \"#general\",\\
    body: \"hello\"\\
    _id: ...,\\
    _creationTime: ...\\
  }]
}

```

This React hook contains internal state that will cause a rerender
whenever any of the query results change.

Throws an error if not used under [ConvexProvider](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#convexprovider).

#### Parameters [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react\\#parameters-12 \"Direct link to Parameters\")

| Name | Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `queries` | [`RequestForQueries`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#requestforqueries) | An object mapping identifiers to objects of `{query: string, args: Record<string, Value> }` describing which query functions to fetch. |

#### Returns [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react\\#returns-15 \"Direct link to Returns\")

`Record` < `string`, `any` \\| `undefined` \\| `Error` >

An object with the same keys as the input. The values are the result
of the query function, `undefined` if it's still loading, or an `Error` if
it threw an exception.

#### Defined in [​](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react\\#defined-in-25 \"Direct link to Defined in\")

# Convex Tutorial: Calling external services

In the [previous step](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/), you built a fully
self-contained chat app. Data in, data out.

In order to power the automatic reactivity we just saw while providing strong
database transactions, query and mutation functions in Convex are not allowed to
make `fetch` calls to the outside world.

Real apps aren't this simple. They often need to talk to the rest of the
internet directly from the backend. Convex lets you do this too via **action**
functions.

Action functions let the sync engine access the external world by scheduling out
work that can then write data back via mutations.

Let's make our chat app a bit smarter by letting anyone in the chat get the
Wikipedia summary of a topic using the Wikipedia API.

## Your first `action` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/actions\\#your-first-action \"Direct link to your-first-action\")

**Add the following action to your `convex/chat.ts` file.**

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// Update your server import like this:
import { query, mutation, internalAction } from \"./_generated/server\";

//...

export const getWikipediaSummary = internalAction({
  args: { topic: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const response = await fetch(
      \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?format=json&action=query&prop=extracts&exintro&explaintext&redirects=1&titles=\" +
        args.topic,
    );

    return getSummaryFromJSON(await response.json());
  },
});

function getSummaryFromJSON(data: any) {
  const firstPageId = Object.keys(data.query.pages)[0];
  return data.query.pages[firstPageId].extract;
}

```

Let's walk through it:

1. First, we created a new Convex action function called `getWikipediaSummary`.
We used `internalAction` because we want this function to be private to the
Convex backend and not exposed as a public API. This function does a simple
fetch to the Wikipedia API with our topic.
2. Next, we have a helper TypeScript function called `getSummaryFromJSON` to
pull out the summary text from the JSON response.
3. The `getWikipediaSummary` function calls our helper function like any other
TypeScript function.

This is great and all, but how do I use it?

To quickly test this function in the Convex dashboard, go to
[https://dashboard.convex.dev](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/functions)
and navigate to your project. Click on the Functions in the left nav, and then
click on the `getWikipediaSummary` function. Click \"Run Function\".

The function runner UI will pop up. Try making a few searches.

Running a few Wikipedia queries

## Hooking it up to your app [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/actions\\#hooking-it-up-to-your-app \"Direct link to Hooking it up to your app\")

It's awesome that we can call Wikipedia, but we still need to show up in our
chat. So, let's hook it all up.

**Update your existing `sendMessage` mutation like this:**

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// Import the api reference
import { api, internal } from \"./_generated/api\";

//...

export const sendMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    user: v.string(),
    body: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    console.log(\"This TypeScript function is running on the server.\");
    await ctx.db.insert(\"messages\", {
      user: args.user,
      body: args.body,
    });

    // Add the following lines:
    if (args.body.startsWith(\"/wiki\")) {
      // Get the string after the first space
      const topic = args.body.slice(args.body.indexOf(\" \") + 1);
      await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, internal.chat.getWikipediaSummary, {
        topic,
      });
    }
  },
});

```

Wait a second! What's with this `ctx.scheduler` stuff? Convex comes with a
powerful durable function scheduler. It's a fundamental part of the sync engine,
and it's the way you coordinate asynchronous functions in Convex.

In the case of mutations, it's the only way to call an action to fetch from the
outside world. The really cool part is, if for some reason your mutation throws
an exception, then nothing is scheduled. This is because mutations are
transactions, and scheduling is just a write in the database to tell Convex to
run this function at a future time.

Ok so, we can schedule our action, but we still need to write the summary back
to the chat.

**Let's go back and update our `getWikipediaSummary` action:**

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
export const getWikipediaSummary = internalAction({
  args: { topic: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const response = await fetch(
      \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?format=json&action=query&prop=extracts&exintro&explaintext&redirects=1&titles=\" +
        args.topic,
    );

    // Replace the `return ...` with the following.
    const summary = getSummaryFromJSON(await response.json());
    await ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, api.chat.sendMessage, {
      user: \"Wikipedia\",
      body: summary,
    });
  },
});

```

Just like scheduling the action, we're now scheduling our `sendMessage` mutation
to send the result of our Wikipedia lookup to our chat.

Go ahead, now play with your app!

## The scheduler, actions, and the sync engine [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/actions\\#the-scheduler-actions-and-the-sync-engine \"Direct link to The scheduler, actions, and the sync engine\")

![Sync engine with actions](https://docs.convex.dev/assets/images/ConvexSyncAction-29b050dc3377673c0d3d21cc60efd709.png)

Queries and mutations are the only ways to interact with the database and the
scheduler enables building sophisticated workflows with actions in between.

[Actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions) are normal serverless functions like AWS
Lambda and Google Cloud Run. They help model flows like calling AI APIs and
using the Vector Store. They serve as an escape hatch. They deal with the
reality of the messy outside world with few guarantees.

Actions are not part of the sync engine. To talk to the database they have to
talk through query and mutation functions. This restriction lets Convex enforce
transactional guarantees in the database and keep the sync engine fast and
nimble.

The best way to structure your application for scale is to minimize the work
that happens in an action. Only the part that needs the
[non-determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm), like
making the external `fetch` call should use them. Keeping them as small as
possible is the most scalable way to build Convex apps, enabling the highest
throughput.

The scheduler allows your app to keep most of its important logic in queries and
mutations and structure your code as workflows in and out of actions.

## What you built [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/actions\\#what-you-built \"Direct link to What you built\")

In this section of the tutorial, you built an action to talk to the outside
world and used the scheduler to trigger this work.

You learned that keeping our actions small and keeping most of our work in
queries and mutations are fundamental to building scalable Convex backends.

## Next up [​](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/actions\\#next-up \"Direct link to Next up\")

You've now learned the most important concepts in Convex. As a full-featured
backend, Convex is capable of many things such as
[authentication](https://docs.convex.dev/auth), [file storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage) and
[search](https://docs.convex.dev/search). You can add those features as needed by following
the documentation.

We touched a little bit on setting your app up for success. As your application
scales, you will run into new challenges. Let's learn how to deal with some of
these challenges in the [next section →](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/scale).

[**Scaling your app** \\\\

Convex was designed from the ground up for scale. In the previous section we](https://docs.convex.dev/tutorial/scale)



[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/swift#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

Learn how to query data from Convex in an application targeting iOS and MacOS
devices built with Swift and SwiftUI.

This quickstart assumes that you have a Mac with Xcode, node and npm installed.
If you don’t have those tools, take time to install them first.

01. Create a new iOS app in Xcode



1. Click _Create New Project_
2. Select iOS App and click _Next_
3. Name your project something like “ConvexQuickstart”
4. Ensure Language is set to Swift and User Interface is SwiftUI
5. Click _Next_

![Create new iOS project](https://docs.convex.dev/screenshots/swift_qs_step_1.png)

02. Configure dependencies



1. Click on the top-level ConvexQuickstart app container in the project
navigator on the left
2. Click on ConvexQuickstart under the PROJECT heading
3. Click the Package Dependencies tab
4. Click the + button (See Screenshot)
5. Paste




```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
https://github.com/get-convex/convex-swift

```








into the search box and press enter
6. When the `convex-swift` package loads, click the _Add Package_ button
7. In the _Package Products_ dialog, select ConvexQuickstart in the
_Add to Target_ dropdown
8. Click the Add Package button

![Add Convex dependency to package](https://docs.convex.dev/screenshots/swift_qs_step_2.png)

04. Install the Convex backend



    Open a terminal and `cd` to the directory for the Xcode project you
    created. Run the following commands to install the Convex client and
    server library.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npm init -y
    npm install convex

    ```

05. Start Convex



    Start a Convex dev deployment. Follow the command line instructions to
    create a new project.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex dev

    ```

06. Create sample data for your database



    Create a new `sampleData.jsonl` file in your Swift project directory with
    these contents











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    {\"text\": \"Buy groceries\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Go for a swim\", \"isCompleted\": true}
    {\"text\": \"Integrate Convex\", \"isCompleted\": false}

    ```

07. Add the sample data to a table called \\`tasks\\` in your database



    Open another terminal tab by pressing ⌘+T which should open in your Swift
    project directory and run











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    npx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl

    ```

08. Expose a database query



    Create a `tasks.ts` file in the `convex/` directory within your Swift
    project with the following contents











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    import { query } from \"./_generated/server\";

    export const get = query({
      args: {},
      handler: async (ctx) => {
        return await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").collect();
      },
    });

    ```

09. Create a Swift struct



    Back in Xcode, create a `struct` at the bottom of the `ContentView` file to
    match the sample data











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    // We're using the name Todo instead of Task to avoid clashing with
    // Swift's builtin Task type.
    struct Todo: Decodable {
      let _id: String
      let text: String
      let isCompleted: Bool
    }

    ```

10. Connect the app to your backend



1. Get the deployment URL of your dev server
with `cat .env.local | grep CONVEX_URL`
2. Create a `ConvexClient` instance near the top of the file, just above the
`ContentView` struct

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import SwiftUI
import ConvexMobile

let convex = ConvexClient(deploymentUrl: \"YOUR_CONVEX_URL\")

struct ContentView: View {
...

```

11. Create your UI



    Replace the default `ContentView` with the following code that will
    refresh the list of todo items whenever the backend data changes.











    ```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
    struct ContentView: View {
      @State private var todos: [Todo] = []

      var body: some View {
        List {
          ForEach(todos, id: \\._id) { todo in
            Text(todo.text)
          }
        }.task {
          for await todos: [Todo] in convex.subscribe(to: \"tasks:get\")
            .replaceError(with: []).values
          {
            self.todos = todos
          }
        }.padding()
      }
    }

    ```

12. Run the app



1. Press ⌘+R or click _Product → Run_
2. You can also try adding, updating or
deleting documents in your `tasks` table at `dashboard.convex.dev` \\- the app
will update with the changes in real-time.

# HTTP APIs

HTTP APIs include:

- [Functions API](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api#functions-api)
- [Streaming export API](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api#streaming-export-api)
- [Streaming import API](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api#streaming-import-api)

## Convex value format [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#convex-value-format \"Direct link to Convex value format\")

Each of the HTTP APIs take a `format` query param that describes how documents
are formatted. Currently the only supported value is `json`. See our
[types page](https://docs.convex.dev/database/types#convex-values) for details. Note that for
simplicity, the `json` format does not support all Convex data types as input,
and uses overlapping representation for several data types in output. We plan to
add a new format with support for all Convex data types in the future.

## API authentication [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#api-authentication \"Direct link to API authentication\")

The Functions API can be optionally authenticated as a user via a bearer token
in a `Authorization` header. The value is `Bearer <access_key>` where the key is
a token from your auth provider. See the
[under the hood](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk#under-the-hood) portion of the Clerk docs for
details on how this works with Clerk.

Streaming export and streaming import requests require deployment admin
authorization via the HTTP header `Authorization`. The value is
`Convex <access_key>` where the access key comes from \"Deploy key\" on the Convex
dashboard and gives full read and write access to your Convex data.

## Functions API [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#functions-api \"Direct link to Functions API\")

### POST `/api/query`, `/api/mutation`, `/api/action` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#post-apiquery-apimutation-apiaction \"Direct link to post-apiquery-apimutation-apiaction\")

These HTTP endpoints allow you to call Convex functions and get the result as a
value.

You can find your backend deployment URL on the dashboard
[Settings](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/deployment-settings) page, then the API URL will
be `<CONVEX_URL>/api/query` etc., for example:

- Shell
- NodeJS

This HTTP endpoint allows you to call arbitrary Convex function types with the
path in the request URL and get the result as a value. The function identifier
is formatted as a string as defined
[here](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#query-names) with a `/` replacing the `:`.

You can find your backend deployment URL on the dashboard

## Streaming export API [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#streaming-export-api \"Direct link to Streaming export API\")

Convex supports streaming export. Convex provides connector implementations for
[Fivetran and Airbyte](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/streaming-import-export).
Those connectors use the following APIs.

Sign up for a [Professional plan](https://www.convex.dev/plans) for streaming
export support. You can also read the
[documentation on streaming export](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/streaming-import-export).

Streaming Export HTTP APIs are in beta

Streaming Export HTTP APIsare currently a [beta\\\\
feature](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/#beta-features). If you have feedback or feature
requests, [let us know on Discord](https://convex.dev/community)!

### GET `/api/json_schemas` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#get-apijson_schemas \"Direct link to get-apijson_schemas\")

The JSON Schemas endpoint lists tables, and for each table describes how
documents will be encoded, given as [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).
This endpoint returns `$description` tags throughout the schema to describe
unintuitive encodings and give extra information like the table referenced by
`Id` fields.

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| deltaSchema | boolean | n | If set, include metadata fields returned by document\\_deltas and list\\_snapshot ( `_ts`, `_deleted`, and `_table`) |
| format | string | n | Output format for values. Valid values: \\[ `json`\\] |

### GET `/api/list_snapshot` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#get-apilist_snapshot \"Direct link to get-apilist_snapshot\")

The `list_snapshot` endpoint walks a consistent snapshot of documents. It may
take one or more calls to `list_snapshot` to walk a full snapshot.

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| snapshot | int | n | Database timestamp at which to continue the snapshot. The timestamp must not be older than 30 days. If omitted, select the latest timestamp. |
| cursor | string | n | An opaque cursor representing the progress in paginating through the snapshot. If omitted, start from the first page of the snapshot. |
| tableName | string | n | If provided, filters the snapshot to a table. If omitted, provide snapshot across all tables. |
| format | string | n | Output format for values. Valid values: \\[ `json`\\] |

**Result JSON**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| values | List\\[ConvexValue\\] | List of convex values in the requested format. Each value includes extra fields `_ts` and `_table`. |
| hasMore | boolean | True if there are more pages to the snapshot. |
| snapshot | int | A value that represents the database timestamp at which the snapshot was taken. |
| cursor | string | An opaque cursor representing the end of the progress on the given page. Pass this to subsequent calls. |

Expected API usage (pseudocode):

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
def list_full_snapshot()
    snapshot_values = []
    snapshot = None
    cursor = None
    while True:
        result = api.list_snapshot(cursor, snapshot)
        snapshot_values.extend(result.values)
        (cursor, snapshot) = (result.cursor, result.snapshot)
        if !result.hasMore:
            break
    return (snapshot_values, result.snapshot)

```

### GET `/api/document_deltas` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#get-apidocument_deltas \"Direct link to get-apidocument_deltas\")

The `document_deltas` endpoint walks the change log of documents to find new,
updated, and deleted documents in the order of their mutations. This order is
given by a `_ts` field on the returned documents. Deletions are represented as
JSON objects with fields `_id`, `_ts`, and `_deleted: true`.

**Query parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cursor | int | y | Database timestamp after which to continue streaming document deltas. Initial value is the `snapshot` field returned from list\\_snapshot. |
| tableName | string | n | If provided, filters the document deltas to a table. If omitted, provide deltas across all tables. |
| format | string | n | Output format for values. Valid values: \\[ `json`\\] |

**Result JSON**

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| values | List\\[ConvexValue\\] | List of convex values in the requested format. Each value includes extra fields for `_ts`, and `_table`. Deletions include a field `_deleted`. |
| hasMore | boolean | True if there are more pages to the snapshot. |
| cursor | int | A value that represents the database timestamp at the end of the page. Pass to subsequent calls to document\\_deltas. |

Expected API usage (pseudocode):

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
def delta_sync(delta_cursor):
    delta_values = []
    while True:
        result = api.document_deltas(cursor)
        delta_values.extend(result.values)
        cursor = result.cursor
        if !hasMore:
            break
    return (delta_values, delta_cursor)

(snapshot_values, delta_cursor) = list_full_snapshot()
(delta_values, delta_cursor) = delta_sync(delta_cursor)
# Save delta_cursor for the next sync

```

## Streaming import API [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#streaming-import-api \"Direct link to Streaming import API\")

Convex supports streaming import. Convex provides a connector implementation for
[Airbyte](https://docs.convex.dev/production/integrations/streaming-import-export). Those
connectors use the following APIs.

Streaming import support is automatically enabled for all Convex projects.

### Headers [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#headers \"Direct link to Headers\")

Streaming import endpoints accept a `Convex-Client: streaming-import-<version>`
header, where the version follows [Semver](https://semver.org/) guidelines. If
this header is not specified, Convex will default to the latest version. We
recommend using the header to ensure the consumer of this API does not break as
the API changes.

### GET `/api/streaming_import/primary_key_indexes_ready` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#get-apistreaming_importprimary_key_indexes_ready \"Direct link to get-apistreaming_importprimary_key_indexes_ready\")

The `primary_key_indexes_ready` endpoint takes a list of table names and returns
true if the primary key indexes (created by `add_primary_key_indexes`) on all
those tables are ready. If the tables are newly created, the indexes should be
ready immediately; however if there are existing documents in the tables, it may
take some time to backfill the primary key indexes. The response looks like:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{
  \"indexesReady\": true
}

```

### PUT `/api/streaming_import/add_primary_key_indexes` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#put-apistreaming_importadd_primary_key_indexes \"Direct link to put-apistreaming_importadd_primary_key_indexes\")

The `add_primary_key_indexes` endpoint takes a JSON body containing the primary
keys for tables and creates indexes on the primary keys to be backfilled. Note
that they are not immediately ready to query - the `primary_key_indexes_ready`
endpoint needs to be polled until it returns True before calling
`import_airbyte_records` with records that require primary key indexes. Also
note that Convex queries will not have access to these added indexes. These are
solely for use in `import_airbyte_records`. The body takes the form of a map of
index names to list of field paths to index. Each field path is represented by a
list of fields that can represent nested field paths.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{
  \"indexes\": {
    \"<table_name>\": [[\"<field1>\"], [\"<field2>\", \"<nested_field>\"]]
  }
}

```

Expected API Usage:

1. Add indexes for primary keys by making a request to
`add_primary_key_indexes`.
2. Poll `primary_key_indexes_ready` until the response is true.
3. Query using the added indexes.

### PUT `api/streaming_import/clear_tables` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#put-apistreaming_importclear_tables \"Direct link to put-apistreaming_importclear_tables\")

The `clear_tables` endpoint deletes all documents from the specified tables.
Note that this may require multiple transactions. If there is an intermediate
error only some documents may be deleted. The JSON body to use this API request
contains a list of table names:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{
  \"tableNames\": [\"<table_1>\", \"<table_2>\"]
}

```

### POST `api/streaming_import/replace_tables` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#post-apistreaming_importreplace_tables \"Direct link to post-apistreaming_importreplace_tables\")

This endpoint is no longer supported. Use `api/streaming_import/clear_tables`
instead.

The `replace_tables` endpoint renames tables with temporary names to their final
names, deleting any existing tables with the final names.

The JSON body to use this API request contains a list of table names:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{
  \"tableNames\": { \"<table_1_temp>\": \"<table_1>\", \"<table_2_temp>\": \"<table_2>\" }
}

```

### POST `api/streaming_import/import_airbyte_records` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api\\#post-apistreaming_importimport_airbyte_records \"Direct link to post-apistreaming_importimport_airbyte_records\")

The `import_airbyte_records` endpoint enables streaming ingress into a Convex
deployment and is designed to be called from an Airbyte destination connector.

It takes a map of streams and a list of messages in the JSON body. Each stream
has a name and JSON schema that will correspond to a Convex table. Streams where
records should be deduplicated include a primary key as well, which is
represented as a list of lists of strings that are field paths. Records for
streams without a primary key are appended to tables; records for streams with a
primary key replace an existing record where the primary key value matches or
are appended if there is no match. If you are using primary keys, you must call
the `add_primary_key_indexes` endpoint first and wait for them to backfill by
polling `primary_key_indexes_ready`.

Each message contains a stream name and a JSON document that will be inserted
(or replaced, in the case of deduplicated sync) into the table with the
corresponding stream name. Table names are same as the stream names. Airbyte
records become Convex documents.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{
   \"tables\": {
      \"<stream_name>\": {
         \"primaryKey\": [[\"<field1>\"], [\"<field2>\", \"<nested_field>\"]],
         \"jsonSchema\": // see https://json-schema.org/ for examples
      }
   },
   \"messages\": [{\\
      \"tableName\": \"<table_name>\",\\
      \"data\": {} // JSON object conforming to the `json_schema` for that stream\\
   }]
}

```

Similar to `clear_tables`, it is possible to execute a partial import using
`import_airbyte_records` if there is a failure after a transaction has
committed.

Expected API Usage:

1. \\[Optional\\] Add any indexes if using primary keys and
[deduplicated sync](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/connections/incremental-deduped-history/)
(see `add_primary_key_indexes` above).
2. \\[Optional\\] Delete all documents in specified tables using `clear_tables` if
using
[overwrite sync](https://docs.airbyte.com/understanding-airbyte/connections/full-refresh-overwrite).
3. Make a request to `import_airbyte_records` with new records to sync and
stream information.

Convex is a great fit for reactive UI frameworks like Svelte. The
[convex-svelte npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convex-svelte)
enhances the [ConvexClient](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/browser.ConvexClient) with declarative
subscriptions in Svelte 5.

See the [Svelte Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/svelte) to get started. The
Svelte client is open source and available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-svelte).

On this page

Bundling is the process of gathering, optimizing and transpiling the JS/TS
source code of [functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions) and their dependencies. During
development and when deploying, the code is transformed to a format that Convex
[runtimes](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes) can directly and efficiently execute.

Convex currently bundles all dependencies automatically, but for the Node.js
runtime you can disable bundling certain packages via the
[external packages](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling#external-packages) config.

## Bundling for Convex [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling\\#bundling-for-convex \"Direct link to Bundling for Convex\")

When you push code either via `npx convex dev` or `npx convex deploy`, the
Convex CLI uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to traverse your `convex/`
folder and bundle your functions and all of their used dependencies into a
source code bundle. This bundle is then sent to the server.

Thanks to bundling you can write your code using both modern ECMAScript Modules
(ESM) or the older CommonJS (CJS) syntax.

ESM vs. CJS

ESM

- Is the standard for browser Javascript
- Uses static imports via the `import` and `export` **keywords** (not functions)
at the global scope
- Also supports dynamic imports via the asynchronous `import` function

CJS

- Was previously the standard module system for Node.js
- Relies on dynamic imports via the `require` and asynchronous `import`
functions for fetching external modules
- Uses the `module.exports` object for exports

## Bundling limitations [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling\\#bundling-limitations \"Direct link to Bundling limitations\")

The nature of bundling comes with a few limitations.

### Code size limits [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling\\#code-size-limits \"Direct link to Code size limits\")

The total size of your bundled function code in your `convex/` folder is
**limited to 32MiB (~33.55MB)**. Other platform limits can be found
[here](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits).

While this limit in itself is quite high for just source code, certain
dependencies can quickly make your bundle size cross over this limit,
particularly if they are not effectively
[tree-shakeable](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) (such as
[aws-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk) or
[snowflake-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snowflake-sdk))

You can follow these steps to debug bundle size:

1. Make sure you're using the most recent version of convex











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm install convex@latest

```

2. Generate the bundle



Note that this will not push code, and just generated a bundle for debugging purposes.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx convex dev --once --debug-bundle-path /tmp/myBundle

```

3. Visualize the bundle



Use
[source-map-explorer](https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer/tree/master)
to visualize your bundle.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npx source-map-explorer /tmp/myBundle/**/*.js

```


Code bundled for the Convex runtime will be in the `isolate` directory while
code bundled for node actions will be in the `node` directory.

Large node dependencies can be eliminated from the bundle by marking them as
[external packages](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling#external-packages).

### Dynamic dependencies [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling\\#dynamic-dependencies \"Direct link to Dynamic dependencies\")

Some libraries rely on dynamic imports (via `import`/ `require` calls) to avoid
always including their dependencies. These imports are not supported by the
[default Convex runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#default-convex-runtime)
and will throw an error at runtime.

Additionally, some libraries rely on local files, which cannot be bundled by
esbuild. If bundling is used, irrespective of the choice of runtime, these
imports will always fail in Convex.

Examples of libraries with dynamic dependencies

Consider the following examples of packages relying on dynamic dependencies:

- [langchain](https://www.npmjs.com/package/langchain) relying on the presence
of peer dependencies that it can dynamically import. These dependencies are
not statically `import` ed so will not be bundled by `esbuild`.
- [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) relying on the presence of
`libvips` binaries for image-processing operations
- [pdf-parse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-parse) relies on being
dynamically imported with `require()` in order to detect if it is being run in
test mode. Bundling can eliminate these `require()` calls, making `pdf-parse`
assume it is running in test mode.
- [tiktoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiktoken) relying on local WASM files

## External packages [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling\\#external-packages \"Direct link to External packages\")

As a workaround for the bundling limitations above, Convex provides an escape
hatch: **external packages**. This feature is currently exclusive to Convex's
[Node.js runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#nodejs-runtime).

External packages use
[`esbuild`'s facility for marking a dependency as external](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#external).
This tells `esbuild` to not bundle the external dependency at all and to leave
the import as a dynamic runtime import using `require()` or `import()`. Thus,
your Convex modules will rely on the underlying system having that dependency
made available at execution-time.

External Packages are in beta

External Packagesare currently a [beta\\\\
feature](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/#beta-features). If you have feedback or feature
requests, [let us know on Discord](https://convex.dev/community)!

### Package installation on the server [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling\\#package-installation-on-the-server \"Direct link to Package installation on the server\")

Packages marked as external are installed from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) the
first time you push code that uses them. The version installed matches the
version installed in the `node_modules` folder on your local machine.

While this comes with a latency penalty the first time you push external
packages, your packages are cached and this install step only ever needs to
rerun if your external packages change. Once cached, pushes can actually be
faster due to smaller source code bundles being sent to the server during
pushes!

### Specifying external packages [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling\\#specifying-external-packages \"Direct link to Specifying external packages\")

Create a [`convex.json`](https://docs.convex.dev/production/project-configuration#convex.json)
file in the same directory as your `package.json` if it does not exist already.
Set the `node.externalPackages` field to `[\"*\"]` to mark all dependencies used
within your Node actions as external:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{
  \"node\": {
    \"externalPackages\": [\"*\"]
  }
}

```

Alternatively, you can explicitly specify which packages to mark as external:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
{
  \"node\": {
    \"externalPackages\": [\"aws-sdk\", \"sharp\"]
  }
}

```

The package identifiers should match the string used in `import`/ `require` in
your
[Node.js action](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions#choosing-the-runtime-use-node).

### Troubleshooting external packages [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling\\#troubleshooting-external-packages \"Direct link to Troubleshooting external packages\")

#### Incorrect package versions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling\\#incorrect-package-versions \"Direct link to Incorrect package versions\")

The Convex CLI searches for external packages within your local `node_modules`
directory. Thus, changing version of a package in the `package.json` will not
affect the version used on the server until you've updated the package version
installed in your local `node_modules` folder (e.g. running `npm install`).

#### Import errors [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling\\#import-errors \"Direct link to Import errors\")

Marking a dependency as external may result in errors like this:

> The requested module \"some-module\" is a CommonJs module, which may not support
> all module.exports as named exports. CommonJs modules can always be imported
> via the default export

This requires rewriting any imports for this module as follows:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
// ❌ old
import { Foo } from \"some-module\";

// ✅ new
import SomeModule from \"some-module\";
const { Foo } = SomeModule;

```

### Limitations [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/bundling\\#limitations \"Direct link to Limitations\")

The total size of your source code bundle and external packages cannot exceed
the following:

- 45MB zipped
- 240MB unzipped

Packages that are known not to work at this time:

- [Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) \\- browser binary
installation exceeds the size limit
- [@ffmpeg.wasm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ffmpeg/ffmpeg) \\- since 0.12.0,
[no longer supports Node environments](https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/docs/faq#why-ffmpegwasm-doesnt-support-nodejs)

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/internal-functions#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

Internal functions can only be called by other [functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions)
and cannot be called directly from a [Convex client](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react).

By default your Convex functions are public and accessible to clients. Public
functions may be called by malicious users in ways that cause surprising
results. Internal functions help you mitigate this risk. We recommend using
internal functions any time you're writing logic that should not be called from
a client.

While internal functions help mitigate risk by reducing the public surface area
of your application, you can still validate internal invariants using
[argument validation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/validation) and/or
[authentication](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/functions-auth).

## Use cases for internal functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/internal-functions\\#use-cases-for-internal-functions \"Direct link to Use cases for internal functions\")

Leverage internal functions by:

- Calling them from [actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions#action-context) via
`runQuery` and `runMutation`
- Calling them from [HTTP actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions) via
`runQuery`, `runMutation`, and `runAction`
- [Scheduling](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions) them from other
functions to run in the future
- Scheduling them to run periodically from
[cron jobs](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs)
- Running them using the
[Dashboard](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/functions#running-functions)
- Running them from the [CLI](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#run-convex-functions)

## Defining internal functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/internal-functions\\#defining-internal-functions \"Direct link to Defining internal functions\")

An internal function is defined using `internalQuery`, `internalMutation`, or
`internalAction`. For example:

convex/plans.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { internalMutation } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const markPlanAsProfessional = internalMutation({
  args: { planId: v.id(\"plans\") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    await ctx.db.patch(args.planId, { planType: \"professional\" });
  },
});

```

If you need to pass complicated objects to internal functions you might prefer
to not use argument validation. Note though that if you're using `internalQuery`
or `internalMutation` it's a better idea to pass around document IDs instead of
documents, to ensure the query or mutation is working with the up-to-date state
of the database.

Internal function without argument validation

convex/plans.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { internalAction } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { Doc } from \"./_generated/dataModel\";

export const markPlanAsProfessional = internalAction({
  handler: async (actionCtx, args) => {
    // perform an action, perhaps calling a third-party API
  },
});

```

## Calling internal functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/internal-functions\\#calling-internal-functions \"Direct link to Calling internal functions\")

Internal functions can be called from actions and scheduled from actions and
mutation using the [`internal`](https://docs.convex.dev/generated-api/api#internal) object.

For example, consider this public `upgrade` action that calls the internal
`plans.markPlanAsProfessional` mutation we defined above:

convex/changes.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { action } from \"./_generated/server\";
import { internal } from \"./_generated/api\";
import { v } from \"convex/values\";

export const upgrade = action({
  args: {
    planId: v.id(\"plans\"),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Call out to payment provider (e.g. Stripe) to charge customer
    const response = await fetch(\"https://...\");
    if (response.ok) {
      // Mark the plan as \"professional\" in the Convex DB
      await ctx.runMutation(internal.plans.markPlanAsProfessional, {
        planId: args.planId,
      });
    }
  },
});

```

In this example a user should not be able to directly call
`internal.plans.markPlanAsProfessional` without going through the `upgrade`
action — if they did, then they would get a free upgrade.

You can define public and internal functions in the same file.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/client/tanstack-query#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

[TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) is an excellent, popular
library for managing requests to a server.

The
[`@convex-dev/react-query`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@convex-dev/react-query)
library provides
[Query Option](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/query-options)
functions for use with TanStack Query.

Not all features of the standard [Convex React client](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react) are
available through the TanStack Query APIs but you can use the two alongside each
other, dropping into the standard Convex React hooks as necessary.

The TanStack Query adapter is in beta

The TanStack Query adapteris currently a [beta\\\\
feature](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/#beta-features). If you have feedback or feature
requests, [let us know on Discord](https://convex.dev/community)!

This makes subscribing to a Convex query function using the TanStack Query
`useQuery` hook look like this:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const { data, isPending, error } = useQuery(convexQuery(api.messages.list, {}));

```

Instead of the typical polling pattern for API endpoints used with TanStack
Query, the code above receives updates for this `api.messages.list` query from
the Convex server reactively. New results for all relevant subscriptions are
pushed to the client where they update at the same time so data is never stale
and there's no need to manually invalidate queries.

Support for other frameworks

Currently only [React\\\\
Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) is
supported via
[`@convex-dev/react-query`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@convex-dev/react-query).
[Let us know](https://convex.dev/community) if you would find support for
vue-query, svelte-query, solid-query, or angular-query helpful.

## Setup [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/tanstack-query\\#setup \"Direct link to Setup\")

To get live updates in TanStack Query create a `ConvexQueryClient` and connect
it to the TanStack Query
[QueryClient](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/reference/QueryClient).
After installing the adapter library with

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm i @convex-dev/react-query

```

wire up Convex to TanStack Query like this:

src/main.tsx

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { ConvexQueryClient } from \"@convex-dev/react-query\";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from \"@tanstack/react-query\";
import { ConvexProvider, ConvexReactClient } from \"convex/react\";
import ReactDOM from \"react-dom/client\";
import App from \"./App\";
import \"./index.css\";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(import.meta.env.VITE_CONVEX_URL);
const convexQueryClient = new ConvexQueryClient(convex);
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      queryKeyHashFn: convexQueryClient.hashFn(),
      queryFn: convexQueryClient.queryFn(),
    },
  },
});
convexQueryClient.connect(queryClient);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\")!).render(
  <ConvexProvider client={convex}>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </ConvexProvider>,
);

```

Note that when your create your React tree you should both:

- wrap your app in the TanStack Query
[`QueryClientProvider`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/QueryClientProvider)
so you can use
[TanStack Query hooks](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/useQuery)
and
- wrap your app in the [`ConvexProvider`](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/react#convexprovider) so
you can also use normal [Convex React](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react) hooks

## Queries [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/tanstack-query\\#queries \"Direct link to Queries\")

A live-updating subscription to a Convex
[query](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) is as simple as calling TanStack
[`useQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/useQuery)
with `convexQuery`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useQuery } from \"@tanstack/react-query\";
import { convexQuery } from \"@convex-dev/react-query\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function App() {
  const { data, isPending, error } = useQuery(
    convexQuery(api.functions.myQuery, { id: 123 }),
  );
  return isPending ? \"Loading...\" : data;
}

```

You can spread the object returned by `convexQuery` into an object specifying
additional
[arguments of `useQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/useQuery).

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
const { data, isPending, error } = useQuery({
  ...convexQuery(api.functions.myQuery, { id: 123 }),
  initialData: [], // use an empty list if no data is available yet
  gcTime: 10000, // stay subscribed for 10 seconds after this component unmounts
});

```

## Mutations [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/tanstack-query\\#mutations \"Direct link to Mutations\")

Your app can call Convex [mutations](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) by
using the TanStack
[`useMutation`](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/useMutation)
hook, and setting the `mutationFn` property to the result of calling
`useConvexMutation`:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { useMutation } from \"@tanstack/react-query\";
import { useConvexMutation } from \"@convex-dev/react-query\";
import { api } from \"../convex/_generated/api\";

export function App() {
  const { mutate, isPending } = useMutation({
    mutationFn: useConvexMutation(api.functions.doSomething),
  });
  return <button onClick={() => mutate({a: \"Hello\"})}>Click me</button>;
}

```

`useConvexMutation` is just a re-export of the
[`useMutation`](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#editing-data) hook from
[Convex React](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react).

## Differences from using `fetch` with TanStack Query [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/tanstack-query\\#differences-from-using-fetch-with-tanstack-query \"Direct link to differences-from-using-fetch-with-tanstack-query\")

Convex provides stronger guarantees than other methods of fetching data with
React Query, so some options and return value properties are no longer
necessary.

Subscriptions to Convex queries will remain active after the last component
using `useQuery` for a given function unmounts for `gcTime` milliseconds. This
value is 5 minutes by default; if this results in unwanted function activity use
a smaller value.

Data provided by Convex is never stale, so the `isStale` property of the return
value of `useQuery` will always be false. `retry`-related options are ignored,
since Convex provides its own retry mechanism over its WebSocket protocol.
`refetch`-related options are similarly ignored since Convex queries are always
up to date.

A validator for a Convex value.

This should be constructed using the validator builder, [v](https://docs.convex.dev/api/modules/values#v).

A validator encapsulates:

- The TypeScript type of this value.
- Whether this field should be optional if it's included in an object.
- The TypeScript type for the set of index field paths that can be used to
build indexes on this value.
- A JSON representation of the validator.

Specific types of validators contain additional information: for example
an `ArrayValidator` contains an `element` property with the validator
used to validate each element of the list. Use the shared 'kind' property
to identity the type of validator.

More validators can be added in future releases so an exhaustive
switch statement on validator `kind` should be expected to break
in future releases of Convex.

Convex documents are uniquely identified by their `Id`, which is accessible
on the `_id` field. To learn more, see [Document IDs](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids).

Documents can be loaded using `db.get(id)` in query and mutation functions.

IDs are base 32 encoded strings which are URL safe.

IDs are just strings at runtime, but this type can be used to distinguish them from other
strings at compile time.

If you're using code generation, use the `Id` type generated for your data model in
`convex/_generated/dataModel.d.ts`.

Install [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and the [`convex-test`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convex-test) library.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm install --save-dev convex-test vitest @edge-runtime/vm

```

2. Setup NPM scripts



Add these scripts to your `package.json`









package.json





```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
\"scripts\": {
     \"test\": \"vitest\",
     \"test:once\": \"vitest run\",
     \"test:debug\": \"vitest --inspect-brk --no-file-parallelism\",
     \"test:coverage\": \"vitest run --coverage --coverage.reporter=text\",
}

```

3. Configure Vitest



Add `vitest.config.mts` file to configure the test
environment to better match the Convex runtime, and to inline the test library
for better dependency tracking.













vitest.config.mts







TS

















```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { defineConfig } from \"vitest/config\";

export default defineConfig({
     test: {
       environment: \"edge-runtime\",
       server: { deps: { inline: [\"convex-test\"] } },
     },
});

```

4. Add a test file



In your `convex` folder add a file ending in `.test.ts`



The example test calls the `api.messages.send` mutation twice
and then asserts that the `api.messages.list` query returns
the expected results.













convex/messages.test.ts







TS

















```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { convexTest } from \"convex-test\";
import { expect, test } from \"vitest\";
import { api } from \"./_generated/api\";
import schema from \"./schema\";

test(\"sending messages\", async () => {
     const t = convexTest(schema);
     await t.mutation(api.messages.send, { body: \"Hi!\", author: \"Sarah\" });
     await t.mutation(api.messages.send, { body: \"Hey!\", author: \"Tom\" });
     const messages = await t.query(api.messages.list);
     expect(messages).toMatchObject([\\
       { body: \"Hi!\", author: \"Sarah\" },\\
       { body: \"Hey!\", author: \"Tom\" }\\
     ]);
});

```

5. Run tests



Start the tests with `npm run test`. When you change the test file or your
functions the tests will rerun automatically.











```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm run test

```


If you're not familiar with Vitest or Jest read the
[Vitest Getting Started docs](https://vitest.dev/guide) first.

## `convexTest` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#convextest \"Direct link to convextest\")

The library exports a `convexTest` function which should be called at the start
of each of your tests. The function returns an object which is by convention
stored in the `t` variable and which provides methods for exercising your Convex
functions.

If your project uses a [schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) you should pass it
to the `convexTest` function:

convex/myFunctions.test.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { convexTest } from \"convex-test\";
import { test } from \"vitest\";
import schema from \"./schema\";

test(\"some behavior\", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema);
  // use `t`...
});

```

Passing in the schema is required for the tests to correctly implement schema
validation and for correct typing of
[`t.run`](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test#setting-up-and-inspecting-data-and-storage-with-trun).

If you don't have a schema, call `convexTest()` with no argument.

## Calling functions with `t.query`, `t.mutation` and `t.action` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#calling-functions-with-tquery-tmutation-and-taction \"Direct link to calling-functions-with-tquery-tmutation-and-taction\")

Your test can call public and internal Convex [functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions)
in your project:

convex/myFunctions.test.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { convexTest } from \"convex-test\";
import { test } from \"vitest\";
import { api, internal } from \"./_generated/api\";

test(\"functions\", async () => {
  const t = convexTest();
  const x = await t.query(api.myFunctions.myQuery, { a: 1, b: 2 });
  const y = await t.query(internal.myFunctions.internalQuery, { a: 1, b: 2 });
  const z = await t.mutation(api.myFunctions.mutateSomething, { a: 1, b: 2 });
  const w = await t.mutation(internal.myFunctions.mutateSomething, { a: 1 });
  const u = await t.action(api.myFunctions.doSomething, { a: 1, b: 2 });
  const v = await t.action(internal.myFunctions.internalAction, { a: 1, b: 2 });
});

```

## Setting up and inspecting data and storage with `t.run` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#setting-up-and-inspecting-data-and-storage-with-trun \"Direct link to setting-up-and-inspecting-data-and-storage-with-trun\")

Sometimes you might want to directly [write](https://docs.convex.dev/database/writing-data) to
the mock database or [file storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage) from your test,
without needing a declared function in your project. You can use the `t.run`
method which takes a handler that is given a `ctx` that allows reading from and
writing to the mock backend:

convex/tasks.test.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { convexTest } from \"convex-test\";
import { expect, test } from \"vitest\";

test(\"functions\", async () => {
  const t = convexTest();
  const firstTask = await t.run(async (ctx) => {
    await ctx.db.insert(\"tasks\", { text: \"Eat breakfast\" });
    return await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").first();
  });
  expect(firstTask).toMatchObject({ text: \"Eat breakfast\" });
});

```

## Testing HTTP actions with `t.fetch` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#testing-http-actions-with-tfetch \"Direct link to testing-http-actions-with-tfetch\")

Your test can call [HTTP actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions) registered
by your router:

convex/http.test.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { convexTest } from \"convex-test\";
import { test } from \"vitest\";

test(\"functions\", async () => {
  const t = convexTest();
  const response = await t.fetch(\"/some/path\", { method: \"POST\" });
});

```

Mocking the global `fetch` function doesn't affect `t.fetch`, but you can use
`t.fetch` in a `fetch` mock to route to your HTTP actions.

## Testing scheduled functions [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#testing-scheduled-functions \"Direct link to Testing scheduled functions\")

One advantage of using a mock implementation running purely in JavaScript is
that you can control time in the Vitest test environment. To test
implementations relying on
[scheduled functions](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions) use
[Vitest's fake timers](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html#timers) in
combination with `t.finishInProgressScheduledFunctions`:

convex/scheduling.test.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { convexTest } from \"convex-test\";
import { expect, test, vi } from \"vitest\";
import { api } from \"./_generated/api\";
import schema from \"./schema\";

test(\"mutation scheduling action\", async () => {
  // Enable fake timers
  vi.useFakeTimers();

  const t = convexTest(schema);

  // Call a function that schedules a mutation or action
  const scheduledFunctionId = await t.mutation(
    api.scheduler.mutationSchedulingAction,
    { delayMs: 10000 },
  );

  // Advance the mocked time
  vi.advanceTimersByTime(5000);

  // Advance the mocked time past the scheduled time of the function
  vi.advanceTimersByTime(6000);

  // Or run all currently pending timers
  vi.runAllTimers();

  // At this point the scheduled function will be `inProgress`,
  // now wait for it to finish
  await t.finishInProgressScheduledFunctions();

  // Assert that the scheduled function succeeded or failed
  const scheduledFunctionStatus = t.run(async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.db.get(scheduledFunctionId);
  });
  expect(scheduledFunctionStatus).toMatchObject({ state: { kind: \"success\" } });

  // Reset to normal `setTimeout` etc. implementation
  vi.useRealTimers();
});

```

If you have a chain of several scheduled functions, for example a mutation that
schedules an action that schedules another action, you can use
`t.finishAllScheduledFunctions` to wait for all scheduled functions, including
recursively scheduled functions, to finish:

convex/chainedScheduling.test.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { convexTest } from \"convex-test\";
import { expect, test, vi } from \"vitest\";
import { api } from \"./_generated/api\";
import schema from \"./schema\";

test(\"mutation scheduling action scheduling action\", async () => {
  // Enable fake timers
  vi.useFakeTimers();

  const t = convexTest(schema);

  // Call a function that schedules a mutation or action
  await t.mutation(api.scheduler.mutationSchedulingActionSchedulingAction);

  // Wait for all scheduled functions, repeatedly
  // advancing time and waiting for currently in-progress
  // functions to finish
  await t.finishAllScheduledFunctions(vi.runAllTimers);

  // Assert the resulting state after all scheduled functions finished
  const createdTask = t.run(async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.db.query(\"tasks\").first();
  });
  expect(createdTask).toMatchObject({ author: \"AI\" });

  // Reset to normal `setTimeout` etc. implementation
  vi.useRealTimers();
});

```

Check out more examples in
[this file](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-test/blob/main/convex/scheduler.test.ts).

## Testing authentication with `t.withIdentity` [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#testing-authentication-with-twithidentity \"Direct link to testing-authentication-with-twithidentity\")

To test functions which depend on the current [authenticated](https://docs.convex.dev/auth)
user identity you can create a version of the `t` accessor with given
[user identity attributes](https://docs.convex.dev/api/interfaces/server.UserIdentity). If you don't
provide them, `issuer`, `subject` and `tokenIdentifier` will be generated
automatically:

convex/tasks.test.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { convexTest } from \"convex-test\";
import { expect, test } from \"vitest\";
import { api } from \"./_generated/api\";
import schema from \"./schema\";

test(\"authenticated functions\", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema);

  const asSarah = t.withIdentity({ name: \"Sarah\" });
  await asSarah.mutation(api.tasks.create, { text: \"Add tests\" });

  const sarahsTasks = await asSarah.query(api.tasks.list);
  expect(sarahsTasks).toMatchObject([{ text: \"Add tests\" }]);

  const asLee = t.withIdentity({ name: \"Lee\" });
  const leesTasks = await asLee.query(api.tasks.list);
  expect(leesTasks).toEqual([]);
});

```

## Mocking `fetch` calls [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#mocking-fetch-calls \"Direct link to mocking-fetch-calls\")

You can use Vitest's
[vi.stubGlobal](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html#globals) method:

convex/ai.test.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { expect, test, vi } from \"vitest\";
import { convexTest } from \"../index\";
import { api } from \"./_generated/api\";
import schema from \"./schema\";

test(\"ai\", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema);

  vi.stubGlobal(
    \"fetch\",
    vi.fn(async () => ({ text: async () => \"I am the overlord\" }) as Response),
  );

  const reply = await t.action(api.messages.sendAIMessage, { prompt: \"hello\" });
  expect(reply).toEqual(\"I am the overlord\");

  vi.unstubAllGlobals();
});

```

## Asserting results [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#asserting-results \"Direct link to Asserting results\")

See Vitest's [Expect](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html) reference.

[`toMatchObject()`](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html#tomatchobject) is
particularly helpful when asserting the shape of results without needing to list
every object field.

### Asserting errors [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#asserting-errors \"Direct link to Asserting errors\")

To assert that a function throws, use
[`.rejects.toThrowError()`](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html#tothrowerror):

convex/messages.test.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { convexTest } from \"convex-test\";
import { expect, test } from \"vitest\";
import { api } from \"./_generated/api\";
import schema from \"./schema\";

test(\"messages validation\", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema);
  expect(async () => {
    await t.mutation(api.messages.send, { body: \"\", author: \"James\" });
  }).rejects.toThrowError(\"Empty message body is not allowed\");
});

```

## Measuring test coverage [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#measuring-test-coverage \"Direct link to Measuring test coverage\")

You can get a printout of the code coverage provided by your tests. Besides
answering the question \"how much of my code is covered by tests\" it is also
helpful to check that your test is actually exercising the code that you want it
to exercise.

Run `npm run test:coverage`

``

. It will ask you to
install a required dependency the first time you run it.

![example coverage printout](https://docs.convex.dev/screenshots/testing_coverage.png)

## Debugging tests [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#debugging-tests \"Direct link to Debugging tests\")

You can attach a debugger to the running tests. Read the Vitest
[Debugging docs](https://vitest.dev/guide/debugging.html) and then
use `npm run test:debug`

``

.

## Multiple environments [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#multiple-environments \"Direct link to Multiple environments\")

If you want to use Vitest to test both your Convex functions and your React
frontend, you might want to use multiple Vitest environments depending on the
test file location via
[environmentMatchGlobs](https://vitest.dev/guide/debugging.html):

vitest.config.mts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { defineConfig } from \"vitest/config\";

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environmentMatchGlobs: [\\
      // all tests in convex/ will run in edge-runtime\\
      [\"convex/**\", \"edge-runtime\"],\\
      // all other tests use jsdom\\
      [\"**\", \"jsdom\"],\\
    ],
    server: { deps: { inline: [\"convex-test\"] } },
  },
});

```

## Custom `convex/` folder name or location [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#multiple-environments \"Direct link to Multiple environments\")

If your project has a
[different name or location configured](https://vitest.dev/config/#environmentmatchglobs)
for the `convex/` folder in `convex.json`, you need to call
[`import.meta.glob`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features#glob-import) and pass the
result as the second argument to `convexTest`.

The argument to `import.meta.glob` must be a glob pattern matching all the files
containing your Convex functions. The paths are relative to the test file in
which `import.meta.glob` is called. It's best to do this in one place in your
custom functions folder:

src/convex/test.setup.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
/// <reference types=\"vite/client\" />
export const modules = import.meta.glob(\"./**/!(*.*.*)*.*s\");

```

This example glob pattern includes all files with a single extension ending in
`s` (like `js` or `ts`) in the `src/convex` folder and any of its children.

Use the result in your tests:

src/convex/messages.test.ts

TS

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { convexTest } from \"convex-test\";
import { test } from \"vitest\";
import schema from \"./schema\";
import { modules } from \"./test.setup\";

test(\"some behavior\", async () => {
  const t = convexTest(schema, modules);
  // use `t`...
});

```

## Limitations [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#limitations \"Direct link to Limitations\")

Since `convex-test` is only a mock implementation, it doesn't have many of the
behaviors of the real Convex backend. Still, it should be helpful for testing
the logic in your functions, and catching regressions caused by changes to your
code.

Some of the ways the mock differs:

- Error messages content. You should not write product logic that relies on the
content of error messages thrown by the real backend, as they are always
subject to change.
- Limits. The mock doesn't enforce size and time
[limits](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits).
- ID format. Your code should not depend on the document or storage ID format.
- Runtime built-ins. Most of your functions are written for the
[Convex default runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes), while Vitest uses a
mock of Vercel's Edge Runtime, which is similar but might differ from the
Convex runtime. You should always test new code manually to make sure it
doesn't use built-ins not available in the Convex runtime.
- Some features have only simplified semantics, namely:
  - [Text search](https://docs.convex.dev/search) returns all documents that include a word
    for which at least one word in the searched string is a prefix. It does not
    implement fuzzy searching and doesn't sort the results by relevance.
  - [Vector search](https://docs.convex.dev/search/vector-search) returns results sorted by
    cosine similarity, but doesn't use an efficient vector index in its
    implementation.
  - There is no support for [cron jobs](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs), you
    should trigger your functions manually from the test.

To test your functions running on a real Convex backend, check out
[Testing Local Backend](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-backend).

## CI [​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test\\#ci \"Direct link to CI\")

See [Continuous Integration](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/ci) to run your tests on a shared
remote machine.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript/bun#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) can be used to run scripts and servers that use Convex
clients and can even run the Convex CLI.

Convex supports point-in-time queries, mutations and actions (see
[HTTP client](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/browser.ConvexHttpClient)) and those plus query
subscriptions (see [ConvexClient](https://docs.convex.dev/api/classes/browser.ConvexClient)) in Bun.

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
import { ConvexHttpClient, ConvexClient } from \"convex/browser\";
import { api } from \"./convex/_generated/api.js\";

// HTTP client
const httpClient = new ConvexHttpClient(process.env.CONVEX_URL);
httpClient.query(api.messages.list).then((messages) => {
  console.log(messages);
});

// Subscription client
const client = new ConvexClient(process.env.CONVEX_URL);
const unsubscribe = client.onUpdate(api.messages.list, {}, (messages) =>
  console.log(messages),
);
await Bun.sleep(1000);
client.mutate(api.messages.send, {}, { body: \"hello!\", author: \"me\" });
await Bun.sleep(1000);

```

## Using Convex with Bun without codegen [​](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript/bun\\#using-convex-with-bun-without-codegen \"Direct link to Using Convex with Bun without codegen\")

You can always use the `anyApi` object or strings if you don't have the Convex
functions and api file handy. An api reference like `api.folder.file.exportName`
becomes `anyApi.folder.file.exportName` or `\"folder/file:exportName\"`.

[Skip to main content](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/convex-auth#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)

On this page

[Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth) is a library for implementing
authentication directly within your Convex backend. This allows you to
authenticate users without needing an authentication service or even a hosting
server. Convex Auth currently supports client-side React web apps served from a
CDN and React Native mobile apps.

**Example:** [Live Demo](https://labs.convex.dev/auth-example)
( [Source](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-auth-example))

Convex Auth is in beta

Convex Authis currently a [beta\\\\
feature](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/#beta-features). If you have feedback or feature
requests, [let us know on Discord](https://convex.dev/community)!

Support for
[authentication in Next.js](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/authz/nextjs) server
components, API routes, middleware, SSR etc. is under active development. If
you'd like to help test this experimental support please
[let us know how it goes in Discord](https://convex.dev/community).

## Get Started [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/convex-auth\\#get-started \"Direct link to Get Started\")

To start a new project from scratch with Convex and Convex Auth, run:

```codeBlockLines_zEuJ
npm create convex@latest

```

and choose `React (Vite)` and `Convex Auth`.

* * *

To add Convex Auth to an existing project, follow the full
[setup guide](https://labs.convex.dev/auth/setup).

## Overview [​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/convex-auth\\#overview \"Direct link to Overview\")

Convex Auth enables you to implement the following authentication methods:

1. Magic Links & OTPs - send a link or code via email
2. OAuth - sign in with Github / Google / Apple etc.
3. Passwords - including password reset flow and optional email verification

The library doesn't come with UI components, but you can copy code from the docs
and example repo to quickly build a UI in React.
