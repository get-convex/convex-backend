# Components example

Run a local backend with components enabled:

```bash
just run-backend
```

Run `convex dev` against the local backend (be sure to `just rush build` if
needed):

```bash
just convex dev
```

Try running the demo function:

```bash
just convex run messages:componentTest
```

# In progress

### Bundling

Definitions work but no explicit functions are being sent up so only implicit
exports are working really.

Some confusion around terms ComponentPath, DefinitionPath, etc.

### Authoring a component

When authoring a component a developer needs to

- run `npx component create somewhere/myComponent`

### Codegen

Components need to generate

1. `_generated/server.ts` for its function wrappers like mutation() generated
   specifically for

   - the parameters of the component definition, (use analysis)
   - the component definition's schema (could be a type import?)
   - the component definitions's child components (use analysis)

2. `_generated/api.ts` for functions to call and schedule other functions. This
   could just be the old lazy api since this isn't imported in the component
   definition.

3. `_generated/component.ts` for the types for `defineComponent` that wil be
   used by componentDefinitions? This will be an autocompletion stumbling block
   no worse than for implementations.

None of these are implemented yet.

For codegen we need a notion of "these components are part of this project; we
are responsible for runnign codegen for them.

When importing a component definition from another package we should consider it
"frozen;' it's read-only, and when we analyze it, we don't need to generate any
code to "fix" the types.

Allow transistive imports of component definitions

Node.js bundles

registerEsbuildReads needs to be stretched out between the two esbuild
invocations! Changes to the component definition dep tree will not be picked up
or invalidated.
