It's useful to vendor dependencies that are pretty stable and unlikely to
receive security updates: we can remove parts we don't use for a smaller bundle
and we spare our users runtime dependencies to install. We know how our library
needs to be bundled,

Some thoughts from tmwc on this:

We're currently vendoring just a few libraries:

1. long.js, which only need a small amount of functionality of.
1. jwt-decode which has caused some users trouble when installing deps
1. jwt-encode is gone from GitHub, very short, and the published version uses an
   old crypto lib we can avoid using by vendoring and swapping it out.
