Get the function metadata from a Convex deployment.

Returns an array of structured objects for each function the deployment. Each function's
metadata contains its identifier (which is its path within the convex/ folder joined
with its exported name), its argument validator, its return value validator, its type
(i.e. is it a query, mutation, or action), and its visibility (i.e. is it public or
internal).
