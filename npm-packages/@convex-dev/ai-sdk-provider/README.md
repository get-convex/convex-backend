# `@convex-dev/ai-sdk-provider`

Use the Convex AI gateway with the AI SDK from a Convex action.

```ts
"use node";

import { convexGateway } from "@convex-dev/ai-sdk-provider";
import { embedMany, generateText } from "ai";
import { action } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const chat = action({
  args: { prompt: v.string() },
  handler: async (_ctx, { prompt }) => {
    const { text } = await generateText({
      model: convexGateway("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5"),
      prompt,
    });
    return text;
  },
});

export const embed = action({
  args: { values: v.array(v.string()) },
  handler: async (_ctx, { values }) => {
    const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
      model: convexGateway.embeddingModel("openai/text-embedding-3-small"),
      values,
    });
    return embeddings;
  },
});
```

Embedding batches larger than the gateway's 512-input limit are split into
multiple requests by the AI SDK.

## Choose a model interface

For text generation, start with `convexGateway(model)`. It works across model
providers and is the recommended default. Use an endpoint-specific model only
when you need features unique to Anthropic Messages or OpenAI Responses:

```ts
convexGateway.messages("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5");
convexGateway.responses("openai/gpt-5");
```

## Structured decisions

Use provider version 0.2.1 or later for correct validation of Jev's rounded
scores and probabilities.

[Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai/introduction) evaluates `choice`, `score`, and
`boolean` questions about the context you provide in `state`. Call AI SDK's
experimental `evaluate` from an action:

```ts
import { experimental_evaluate as evaluate } from "ai";
import { convexGateway } from "@convex-dev/ai-sdk-provider";

const decision = await evaluate({
  model: convexGateway.evaluationModel("typesafe/jev-1.13"),
  state: { ticket: "Customer cannot sign in" },
  questions: {
    priority: {
      type: "choice",
      instructions: "Choose the response priority",
      criteria: {
        urgent: "Respond now",
        normal: "Respond today",
      },
    },
    needsReview: {
      type: "boolean",
      instructions: "Does a human need to review this?",
    },
  },
});

console.log(decision.answers.priority.choice);
console.log(decision.answers.needsReview.probability);
```

This requires AI SDK 7.0.105 or later. The evaluation interface and
`/alpha/decisions` endpoint are experimental. Authentication is handled
automatically. Pass `abortSignal` to `evaluate` to cancel a request. Dollar cost
is available in `decision.providerMetadata?.convexGateway?.cost`. The original
gateway response, including provider-specific fields such as `confidence`, is
available in `decision.response.body`.

`getServiceToken("ai-gateway")` supplies a short-lived deployment JWT. The
action runtime caches and refreshes the credential as needed, so
`convexGateway(...)` is recommended to call it repeatedly.

Requires Convex 1.45 or later, AI SDK 7.0.105 or later, and Node.js 22 or later.

## Generate images

Image generation is in alpha. The request and response format may change.

```ts
import { generateImage } from "ai";
import { convexGateway } from "@convex-dev/ai-sdk-provider";

const { images } = await generateImage({
  model: convexGateway.imageModel("openai/gpt-image-1"),
  prompt: "A mountain lake at sunrise",
});
```

Image request costs are available in
`result.calls[i].providerMetadata.convexGateway.cost`, in US dollars. Each call
may generate multiple images; the cost is for the call, not each image.

## Generate videos

Video generation is in alpha. APIs may change, and completion callbacks are best
effort. Save async operation handles to check status and retrieve results.

```ts
import { experimental_generateVideo as generateVideo } from "ai";
import { convexGateway } from "@convex-dev/ai-sdk-provider";

const { video, providerMetadata } = await generateVideo({
  model: convexGateway.videoModel("google/veo-3.1"),
  prompt: "A camera pan across a mountain lake",
  duration: 8,
  aspectRatio: "16:9",
  resolution: "1280x720",
});

const bytes = video.uint8Array;
const cost = providerMetadata?.convexGateway?.cost;
```

The call waits for generation and download, with a ten-minute default timeout
and a 64 MiB limit per video. Store the returned bytes in Convex file storage.
The AI SDK splits `n > 1` into separate requests. Cancelling a request does not
cancel the upstream job and can still incur a charge.

An image in the prompt becomes the first frame. Use `frameImages` for explicit
frames, `inputReferences` for image/audio/video references, and `generateAudio`
for audio. `fps` returns an unsupported-option warning.

`providerOptions.convexGateway` accepts `resolution` (such as `720p`),
`generate_audio`, `frame_images`, and `input_references`. Standard SDK options
take precedence. Supported values depend on the
[OpenRouter model](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/overview/multimodal/video-generation).

## Async videos

With AI SDK 7.0.83, use `experimental_startVideo` to submit a job without
waiting for the video. See the
[async availability requirements](https://docs.convex.dev/ai-gateway/images-and-videos#async-videos)
before using these routes.

Create an application job first. Use its ID as `requestId` in the callback URL
so the receiver can find the job and its saved secret.

```ts
import { experimental_startVideo as startVideo } from "ai";
import { convexGateway } from "@convex-dev/ai-sdk-provider";

async function startJob(requestId: string) {
  const modelId = "google/veo-3.1";
  const started = await startVideo({
    model: convexGateway.videoModel(modelId),
    prompt: "A camera pan across a mountain lake",
    duration: 8,
    webhookUrl: `${process.env.CONVEX_SITE_URL}/video-complete?requestId=${requestId}`,
    maxRetries: 0,
  });

  return {
    modelId,
    operation: started.operation,
    inferenceId: started.providerMetadata?.convexGateway?.inferenceId,
    webhookSecret: started.providerMetadata?.convexGateway?.webhookSecret,
  };
}
```

Save the returned job in private application storage before the action returns.
Automatic submission retries are disabled because a lost response can still mean
a paid job was accepted. Callback URLs must use the deployment's own HTTPS
`<deployment>.convex.site` origin; redirects are rejected. If `CONVEX_SITE_URL`
uses a custom domain, use the deployment's default `convex.site` origin in the
example instead.

### Receive a callback

Load the saved job and verify the raw request body before updating application
state:

```ts
import { verifyVideoWebhook } from "@convex-dev/ai-sdk-provider";

const event = await verifyVideoWebhook({
  body: await request.text(),
  signature: request.headers.get("x-convex-video-signature"),
  secret: savedJob.webhookSecret,
});

if (event.id !== savedJob.inferenceId) {
  return new Response("Wrong job", { status: 400 });
}
```

Deduplicate `(event.id, event.status)` in the same mutation that saves the
event. For `completed`, schedule an action to download the video. Record
`failed`, `cancelled`, or `expired` as terminal failures. Return 204 after
saving the event; return a non-2xx response if the job's secret has not been
saved yet.

### Retrieve the video

In a later action, use the saved operation to check status and download:

```ts
const model = convexGateway.videoModel(savedJob.modelId);
const status = await model.getStatus({ operation: savedJob.operation });

if (status.status === "completed") {
  const result = await model.download({ operation: savedJob.operation });
  const video = result.videos[0];
  const cost = result.providerMetadata?.convexGateway?.cost;
}
```

`getStatus` returns `pending`, `completed`, or `error`. When the status is
`error`, the `error` field contains the error message. Store the downloaded
video in application storage, since each `download` call fetches it again.
Operations expire after seven days; upstream video retention may be shorter.

Omit `webhookUrl` to use status checks alone. If a completion callback is
missed, use the saved operation to check the job and retrieve its result.
Applications that need automatic recovery can periodically check unfinished
jobs.
