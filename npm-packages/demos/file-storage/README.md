# File Storage Example App

This example demonstrates how to use Convex file storage to augment Convex Chat
with images.

This app is an extension of the Convex chat tutorial including a new button for
uploading images. Images will be stored in Convex file storage, with their
storage IDs saved in the messages table for access.

To learn more about storage see the
[File Storage](https://docs.convex.dev/using/file-storage) documentation.

## Running the App

Run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
