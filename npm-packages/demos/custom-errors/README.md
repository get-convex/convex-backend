# Custom Errors Example App

This example demonstrates how to use Convex errors from functions and clients.
clients.

This app is an extension of the Convex chat tutorial, where we throw custom
application-level errors if:

1. we try sending a message over 50 characters in length
2. we have more than 20 messages to list

To learn more about application errors see the
[Application Errors](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/error-handling/application-errors)
documentation.

## Running the App

Run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
