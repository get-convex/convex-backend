# Pagination Example App

This example demonstrates how to use
[Convex pagination](https://docs.convex.dev/using/pagination) to create a
paginated list of items.

This app is a paginated messages app. On the first load it will load the most
recent 5 messages and you can load more by clicking "Load More".

New messages will be added to the top page. To see the pagination in action, add
more then 5 messages and then refresh!

## Running the App

Run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
