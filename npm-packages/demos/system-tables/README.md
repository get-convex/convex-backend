# System Tables Example App

This example demonstrates how to use Convex system tables to programmatically
interact with file storage and scheduled functions.

This app is an extension of the Convex chat tutorial including a new button for
uploading images (stored with Convex file storage) and scheduling messages to
send in the future. Then, using the power of system tables, the app exposes an
admin-like interface over scheduled messages & stored files.

To learn more about these two system tables, see the
[File Storage](https://docs.convex.dev/using/file-storage) and
[Scheduled Functions](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions)
documentation.

## Running the App

Run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
