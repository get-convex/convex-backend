# Convex local backend demo

You're just a few clicks away from having a webapp powered by Convex.

Get started by running `npm install` inside of this directory. Then, run
`npx convex dev --url [local url] --admin-key [key]` to get the backend running
locally. Finally, you can use `npm run dev:frontend` to view the frontend. We
hope you enjoy using Convex!
