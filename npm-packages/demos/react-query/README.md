# TypeScript and Schemas Example App

This example demonstrates how to write a Convex app in
[TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/using/typescript).

The Convex functions are written in `.ts` files and the React components use
`.tsx`.

This app also defines a Convex
[schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) in `convex/schema.ts` to
create TypeScript types specific to the app's data model.

## Running the App

Run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
